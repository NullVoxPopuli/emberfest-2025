  mechanic for providing a registry is [declaration merging][handbook].

  [handbook]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html

  For example, Ember's `@ember/service` module includes this set of definitions:

  ```ts
  export default class Service extends EmberObject {}

  // For concrete singleton classes to be merged into.
  interface Registry extends Record<string, Service> {}

  declare module '@ember/owner' {
    service: Registry;
  }
  ```

  Declarations of services can then include the registry:

  ```ts
  import Service from '@ember/service';

  export default class Session extends Service {
    login(username: string, password: string) {
      // ...
    }
  }

  declare module '@ember/service' {
    interface Registry {
      session: Session;
    }
  }
  ```

  Then users of the `Owner` API will be able to do things like this with strong
  type safety guarantees:

  ```ts
  getOwner(this)?.lookup('service:session').login("hello", "1234abcd");
  ```

/**
  Ember’s dependency injection system is built on the idea of an "owner": an

  This module does not provide any concrete instances of owners. Instead, it
  defines the core type, `Owner`, which specifies the public API contract for an
  owner. The primary concrete implementations of `Owner` are `EngineInstance`,
  from `@ember/engine/instance`, and its `ApplicationInstance` subclass, from
  `@ember/application/instance`.

  Along with `Owner` itself, this module provides a number of supporting types
  related to Ember's DI system:

  - `Factory`, Ember's primary interface for something which can create class
    instances registered with the DI system.

  - `FactoryManager`, an interface for inspecting a `Factory`'s class.

  - `Resolver`, an interface defining the contract for the object responsible
    for mapping string names to the corresponding classes. For example, when you
    write `@service('session')`, a resolver is responsible to map that back to
    the `Session` service class in your codebase. Normally, this is handled for
    you automatically with `ember-resolver`, which is the main implementor of
    this interface.

  For more details on each, see their per-item docs.

  `getOwner` fetches the owner object responsible for an instance. This can
  be used to lookup or resolve other class instances, or register new factories
  into the owner.

  For example, this component dynamically looks up a service based on the
  `audioType` passed as an argument:

  ```app/components/play-audio.js

  import { action } from '@ember/object';
  import { getOwner } from '@ember/owner';

  The following example demonstrates its usage by registering a handler that throws an error if the

  ```javascript

  <ul>
    <li> <code>message</code> - The message received from the deprecation call.</li>
    <li> <code>options</code> - An object passed in with the deprecation call containing additional information including:</li>

     Ember itself leverages [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) to aid
    projects in keeping up with changes to the framework. Before any
    functionality or API is removed, it first flows linearly through a
    deprecation staging process. The staging process currently contains two
    stages: available and enabled.
     Deprecations are initially released into the 'available' stage.
    Deprecations will stay in this stage until the replacement API has been
    marked as a recommended practice via the RFC process and the addon
    ecosystem has generally adopted the change.
     Once a deprecation meets the above criteria, it will move into the
    'enabled' stage where it will remain until the functionality or API is
    eventually removed.
     For application and addon developers, "available" deprecations are not
    urgent and "enabled" deprecations require action.

/**
  Strongly hint runtimes to intern the provided string.

  When do I need to use this function?

  For the most part, never. Pre-mature optimization is bad, and often the
  runtime does exactly what you need it to, and more often the trade-off isn't
  worth it.

  Why?

  Runtimes store strings in at least 2 different representations:
  Ropes and Symbols (interned strings). The Rope provides a memory efficient
  data-structure for strings created from concatenation or some other string
  manipulation like splitting.

  Unfortunately checking equality of different ropes can be quite costly as
  runtimes must resort to clever string comparison algorithms. These
  algorithms typically cost in proportion to the length of the string.
  Luckily, this is where the Symbols (interned strings) shine. As Symbols are
  unique by their string content, equality checks can be done by pointer
  comparison.

  How do I know if my string is a rope or symbol?

  Typically (warning general sweeping statement, but truthy in runtimes at
  present) static strings created as part of the JS source are interned.
  Strings often used for comparisons can be interned at runtime if some
  criteria are met.  One of these criteria can be the size of the entire rope.
  For example, in chrome 38 a rope longer then 12 characters will not
  intern, nor will segments of that rope.

  Some numbers: http://jsperf.com/eval-vs-keys/8

/**
  `@computed` is a decorator that turns a JavaScript getter and setter into a
  computed property, which is a _cached, trackable value_. By default the getter
  will only be called once and the result will be cached. You can specify
  various properties that your computed property depends on. This will force the
  cached result to be cleared if the dependencies are modified, and lazily recomputed the next time something asks for it.

  In the following example we decorate a getter - `fullName` -  by calling
  `computed` with the property dependencies (`firstName` and `lastName`) as
  arguments. The `fullName` getter will be called once (regardless of how many
  times it is accessed) as long as its dependencies do not change. Once
  `firstName` or `lastName` are updated any future calls to `fullName` will
  incorporate the new values, and any watchers of the value such as templates
  will be updated:

  ```javascript
  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);
    }

    @computed('firstName', 'lastName')
    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
  });

  let tom = new Person('Tom', 'Dale');

  tom.fullName; // 'Tom Dale'
  ```

  You can also provide a setter, which will be used when updating the computed
  property. Ember's `set` function must be used to update the property
  since it will also notify observers of the property:

  ```javascript
  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);
    }

    @computed('firstName', 'lastName')
    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }

    set fullName(value) {
      let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');

      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);
    }
  });

  let person = new Person();

  set(person, 'fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');
  person.firstName; // 'Peter'
  person.lastName;  // 'Wagenet'
  ```

  You can also pass a getter function or object with `get` and `set` functions
  as the last argument to the computed decorator. This allows you to define
  computed property _macros_:

  ```js
  import { computed } from '@ember/object';

  function join(...keys) {
    return computed(...keys, function() {
      return keys.map(key => this[key]).join(' ');
    });
  }

  class Person {
    @join('firstName', 'lastName')
    fullName;
  }
  ```

  Note that when defined this way, getters and setters receive the _key_ of the
  property they are decorating as the first argument. Setters receive the value
  they are setting to as the second argument instead. Additionally, setters must
  _return_ the value that should be cached:

  ```javascript
  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  function fullNameMacro(firstNameKey, lastNameKey) {
    return computed(firstNameKey, lastNameKey, {
      get() {
        return `${this[firstNameKey]} ${this[lastNameKey]}`;
      }

      set(key, value) {
        let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');

        set(this, firstNameKey, firstName);
        set(this, lastNameKey, lastName);

        return value;
      }
    });
  }

  class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);
    }

    @fullNameMacro('firstName', 'lastName') fullName;
  });

  let person = new Person();

  set(person, 'fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');
  person.firstName; // 'Peter'
  person.lastName;  // 'Wagenet'
  ```

  Computed properties can also be used in classic classes. To do this, we
  provide the getter and setter as the last argument like we would for a macro,
  and we assign it to a property on the class definition. This is an _anonymous_
  computed macro:

  ```javascript
  import EmberObject, { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  let Person = EmberObject.extend({
    // these will be supplied by `create`
    firstName: null,
    lastName: null,

    fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', {
      get() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
      }

      set(key, value) {
        let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');

        set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
        set(this, 'lastName', lastName);

        return value;
      }
    })
  });

  let tom = Person.create({
    firstName: 'Tom',
    lastName: 'Dale'
  });

  tom.get('fullName') // 'Tom Dale'
  ```

  You can overwrite computed property without setters with a normal property (no
  longer computed) that won't change if dependencies change. You can also mark
  computed property as `.readOnly()` and block all attempts to set it.

  ```javascript
  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);
    }

    @computed('firstName', 'lastName').readOnly()
    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
  });

  let person = new Person();
  person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet'); // Uncaught Error: Cannot set read-only property "fullName" on object: <(...):emberXXX>
  ```

    In some cases, you may want to annotate computed properties with additional
    metadata about how they function or what values they operate on. For example,
    computed property functions may close over variables that are then no longer
    available for introspection. You can pass a hash of these values to a
    computed property.
     Example:
     ```javascript
    import { computed } from '@ember/object';
    import Person from 'my-app/utils/person';
     class Store {
      @computed().meta({ type: Person })
      get person() {
        let personId = this.personId;
        return Person.create({ id: personId });
      }
    }
    ```
     Classic Class Example:
     ```javascript
    import { computed } from '@ember/object';
    import Person from 'my-app/utils/person';
     const Store = EmberObject.extend({
      person: computed(function() {
        let personId = this.get('personId');
        return Person.create({ id: personId });
      }).meta({ type: Person })
    });
    ```
     The hash that you pass to the `meta()` function will be saved on the
    computed property descriptor under the `_meta` key. Ember runtime
    exposes a public API for retrieving these values from classes,
    via the `metaForProperty()` function.
     @method meta
    @param {Object} meta
    @chainable
    @public
  */

  meta(meta) {
    let prop = descriptorForDecorator(this);
    if (arguments.length === 0) {

      return this;

}

/**
  This helper returns a new property descriptor that wraps the passed
  computed property function. You can use this helper to define properties with
  native decorator syntax, mixins, or via `defineProperty()`.

  Example:

  ```js
  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  class Person {
    constructor() {
      this.firstName = 'Betty';
      this.lastName = 'Jones';
    },

    @computed('firstName', 'lastName')
    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
  }

  let client = new Person();

  client.fullName; // 'Betty Jones'

  set(client, 'lastName', 'Fuller');
  client.fullName; // 'Betty Fuller'
  ```

  Classic Class Example:

  ```js
  import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';

  let Person = EmberObject.extend({
    init() {
      this._super(...arguments);

      this.firstName = 'Betty';
      this.lastName = 'Jones';
    },

    fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {
      return `${this.get('firstName')} ${this.get('lastName')}`;
    })
  });

  let client = Person.create();

  client.get('fullName'); // 'Betty Jones'

  client.set('lastName', 'Fuller');
  client.get('fullName'); // 'Betty Fuller'
  ```

  You can also provide a setter, either directly on the class using native class
  syntax, or by passing a hash with `get` and `set` functions.

  Example:

  ```js
  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  class Person {
    constructor() {
      this.firstName = 'Betty';
      this.lastName = 'Jones';
    },

    @computed('firstName', 'lastName')
    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }

    set fullName(value) {
      let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(/\s+/);

      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);

      return value;
    }
  }

  let client = new Person();

  client.fullName; // 'Betty Jones'

  set(client, 'lastName', 'Fuller');
  client.fullName; // 'Betty Fuller'
  ```

  Classic Class Example:

  ```js
  import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';

  let Person = EmberObject.extend({
    init() {
      this._super(...arguments);

      this.firstName = 'Betty';
      this.lastName = 'Jones';
    },

    fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', {
      get(key) {
        return `${this.get('firstName')} ${this.get('lastName')}`;
      },
      set(key, value) {
        let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(/\s+/);
        this.setProperties({ firstName, lastName });
        return value;
      }
    })
  });

  let client = Person.create();
  client.get('firstName'); // 'Betty'

  client.set('fullName', 'Carroll Fuller');
  client.get('firstName'); // 'Carroll'
  ```

  When passed as an argument, the `set` function should accept two parameters,
  `key` and `value`. The value returned from `set` will be the new value of the
  property.

/**
  Allows you to specify which context to call the specified function in while
  adding the execution of that function to the Ember run loop. This ability
  makes this method a great way to asynchronously integrate third-party libraries
  into your Ember application.

  `bind` takes two main arguments, the desired context and the function to
  invoke in that context. Any additional arguments will be supplied as arguments
  to the function that is passed in.

  Let's use the creation of a TinyMCE component as an example. Currently,
  TinyMCE provides a setup configuration option we can use to do some processing
  after the TinyMCE instance is initialized but before it is actually rendered.
  We can use that setup option to do some additional setup for our component.
  The component itself could look something like the following:

  ```app/components/rich-text-editor.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';
  import { on } from '@ember/object/evented';
  import { bind } from '@ember/runloop';

  export default Component.extend({
    initializeTinyMCE: on('didInsertElement', function() {
      tinymce.init({
        selector: '#' + this.$().prop('id'),
        setup: bind(this, this.setupEditor)
      });
    }),

    didInsertElement() {
      tinymce.init({
        selector: '#' + this.$().prop('id'),
        setup: bind(this, this.setupEditor)
      });
    }

    setupEditor(editor) {
      this.set('editor', editor);

      editor.on('change', function() {
        console.log('content changed!');
      });
    }
  });
  ```

  In this example, we use `bind` to bind the setupEditor method to the
  context of the RichTextEditor component and to have the invocation of that
  method be safely handled and executed by the Ember run loop.

  @method bind
  @static
  @for @ember/runloop
  @param {Object} [target] target of method to call
  @param {Function|String} method Method to invoke.
    May be a function or a string. If you pass a string
    then it will be looked up on the passed target.
  @param {Object} [args*] Any additional arguments you wish to pass to the method.
  @return {Function} returns a new function that will always have a particular context
  @since 1.4.0

/**
  Schedules a function to run one time in a given queue of the current RunLoop.
  Calling this method with the same queue/target/method combination will have
  no effect (past the initial call).

  Note that although you can pass optional arguments these will not be
  considered when looking for duplicates. New arguments will replace previous
  calls.

  ```javascript
  import { run, scheduleOnce } from '@ember/runloop';

  function sayHi() {
    console.log('hi');
  }

  run(function() {
    scheduleOnce('afterRender', myContext, sayHi);
    scheduleOnce('afterRender', myContext, sayHi);
    // sayHi will only be executed once, in the afterRender queue of the RunLoop
  });
  ```

  Also note that for `scheduleOnce` to prevent additional calls, you need to
  pass the same function instance. The following case works as expected:

  ```javascript
  function log() {
    console.log('Logging only once');
  }

  function scheduleIt() {
    scheduleOnce('actions', myContext, log);
  }

  scheduleIt();
  scheduleIt();
  ```

  But this other case will schedule the function multiple times:

  ```javascript
  import { scheduleOnce } from '@ember/runloop';

  function scheduleIt() {
    scheduleOnce('actions', myContext, function() {
      console.log('Closure');
    });
  }

  scheduleIt();
  scheduleIt();

  // "Closure" will print twice, even though we're using `scheduleOnce`,
  // because the function we pass to it won't match the
  // previously scheduled operation.
  ```

  Available queues, and their order, can be found at `queues`

  @method scheduleOnce
  @static
  @for @ember/runloop
  @param {String} [queue] The name of the queue to schedule against. Default queues is 'actions'.
  @param {Object} [target] The target of the method to invoke.
  @param {Function|String} method The method to invoke.
    If you pass a string it will be resolved on the
    target at the time the method is invoked.
  @param {Object} [args*] Optional arguments to pass to the timeout.

function scheduleOnce(...args) {
  // @ts-expect-error TS doesn't like the rest args here
  return _backburner.scheduleOnce(...args);
}

/**
  Schedules an item to run from within a separate run loop, after
  control has been returned to the system. This is equivalent to calling
  `later` with a wait time of 1ms.

  ```javascript
  import { next } from '@ember/runloop';

  next(myContext, function() {
    // code to be executed in the next run loop,
    // which will be scheduled after the current one
  });
  ```

  Multiple operations scheduled with `next` will coalesce
  into the same later run loop, along with any other operations
  scheduled by `later` that expire right around the same
  time that `next` operations will fire.

  Note that there are often alternatives to using `next`.
  For instance, if you'd like to schedule an operation to happen
  after all DOM element operations have completed within the current
  run loop, you can make use of the `afterRender` run loop queue (added
  by the `ember-views` package, along with the preceding `render` queue
  where all the DOM element operations happen).

  Example:

  ```app/components/my-component.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';
  import { scheduleOnce } from '@ember/runloop';

  export default class MyComponent extends Component {
    didInsertElement() {
      super.didInsertElement();
      scheduleOnce('afterRender', this, 'processChildElements');
    },

    processChildElements() {
      // ... do something with component's child component
      // elements after they've finished rendering, which
      // can't be done within this component's
      // `didInsertElement` hook because that gets run
      // before the child elements have been added to the DOM.
    }
  }
  ```

  One benefit of the above approach compared to using `next` is
  that you will be able to perform DOM/CSS operations before unprocessed
  elements are rendered to the screen, which may prevent flickering or
  other artifacts caused by delaying processing until after rendering.

  The other major benefit to the above approach is that `next`
  introduces an element of non-determinism, which can make things much
  harder to test, due to its reliance on `setTimeout`; it's much harder
  to guarantee the order of scheduled operations when they are scheduled
  outside of the current run loop, i.e. with `next`.

  Delay calling the target method until the debounce period has elapsed
  with no additional debounce calls. If `debounce` is called again before
  the specified time has elapsed, the timer is reset and the entire period
  must pass again before the target method is called.

  This method should be used when an event may be called multiple times
  but the action should only be called once when the event is done firing.
  A common example is for scroll events where you only want updates to
  happen once scrolling has ceased.

  ```javascript
  import { debounce } from '@ember/runloop';

  function whoRan() {
    console.log(this.name + ' ran.');
  }

  let myContext = { name: 'debounce' };

  debounce(myContext, whoRan, 150);

  // less than 150ms passes
  debounce(myContext, whoRan, 150);

  // 150ms passes
  // whoRan is invoked with context myContext
  // console logs 'debounce ran.' one time.
  ```

  Immediate allows you to run the function immediately, but debounce
  other calls for this function until the wait time has elapsed. If
  `debounce` is called again before the specified time has elapsed,
  the timer is reset and the entire period must pass again before
  the method can be called again.

  ```javascript
  import { debounce } from '@ember/runloop';

  }

  let myContext = { name: 'debounce' };

/**
  The `Mixin` class allows you to create mixins, whose properties can be
  added to other classes. For instance,

  ```javascript
  import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';

  const EditableMixin = Mixin.create({
    edit() {
      console.log('starting to edit');
      this.set('isEditing', true);
    },
    isEditing: false
  });
  ```

  ```javascript
  import EmberObject from '@ember/object';
  import EditableMixin from '../mixins/editable';

  // Mix mixins into classes by passing them as the first arguments to
  // `.extend.`
  class Comment extends EmberObject.extend(EditableMixin) {
    post = null
  }

  let comment = Comment.create({
    post: somePost
  });

  comment.edit(); // outputs 'starting to edit'
  ```

  Note that Mixins are created with `Mixin.create`, not
  `Mixin.extend`.

  Note that mixins extend a constructor's prototype so arrays and object literals
  defined as properties will be shared amongst objects that implement the mixin.
  If you want to define a property in a mixin that is not shared, you can define
  it either as a computed property or have it be created on initialization of the object.

  ```javascript
  // filters array will be shared amongst any object implementing mixin
  import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';
  import { A } from '@ember/array';

  const FilterableMixin = Mixin.create({
    filters: A()
  });
  ```

  ```javascript
  import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';
  import { A } from '@ember/array';
  import { computed } from '@ember/object';

  // filters will be a separate array for every object implementing the mixin
  const FilterableMixin = Mixin.create({
    filters: computed(function() {
      return A();
    })
  });
  ```

  ```javascript
  import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';
  import { A } from '@ember/array';

  // filters will be created as a separate array during the object's initialization
  const Filterable = Mixin.create({
    filters: null,

    init() {
      this._super(...arguments);
      this.set("filters", A());
    }
  });

     These functions will be invoked when a matching `{{action}}` is triggered
    from within a template and the application's current route is this route.
     Actions can also be invoked from other parts of your application
    via `ActionHandler#send`.
     The `actions` hash will inherit action handlers from
    the `actions` hash defined on extended parent classes
    or mixins rather than just replace the entire hash, e.g.:
     ```app/mixins/can-display-banner.js
    import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';
     export default Mixin.create({
      actions: {
        displayBanner(msg) {
          // ...
        }
      }
    });
    ```
     ```app/routes/welcome.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
    import CanDisplayBanner from '../mixins/can-display-banner';
     export default Route.extend(CanDisplayBanner, {
      actions: {
        playMusic() {
          // ...
        }
      }
    });
     // `WelcomeRoute`, when active, will be able to respond
    // to both actions, since the actions hash is merged rather
    // then replaced when extending mixins / parent classes.
    this.send('displayBanner');
    this.send('playMusic');
    ```
     Within a Controller, Route or Component's action handler,
    the value of the `this` context is the Controller, Route or
    Component object:
     ```app/routes/song.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
     export default Route.extend({
      actions: {
        myAction() {
          this.controllerFor("song");
          this.transitionTo("other.route");
          ...
        }
      }
    });
    ```
     It is also possible to call `this._super(...arguments)` from within an
    action handler if it overrides a handler defined on a parent
    class or mixin:
     Take for example the following routes:
     ```app/mixins/debug-route.js
    import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';
     export default Mixin.create({
      actions: {
        debugRouteInformation() {
          console.debug("It's a-me, console.debug!");
        }
      }
    });
    ```
     ```app/routes/annoying-debug.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
    import DebugRoute from '../mixins/debug-route';
     export default Route.extend(DebugRoute, {
      actions: {
        debugRouteInformation() {
          // also call the debugRouteInformation of mixed in DebugRoute
          this._super(...arguments);
           // show additional annoyance
          window.alert(...);
        }
      }
    });
    ```
     ## Bubbling
     By default, an action will stop bubbling once a handler defined
    on the `actions` hash handles it. To continue bubbling the action,
    you must return `true` from the handler:
     ```app/router.js
    Router.map(function() {
      this.route("album", function() {
        this.route("song");
      });
    });
    ```
     ```app/routes/album.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
     export default Route.extend({
      actions: {
        startPlaying: function() {
        }
      }
    });
    ```
     ```app/routes/album-song.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
     export default Route.extend({
      actions: {

           if (actionShouldAlsoBeTriggeredOnParentRoute) {

/**
  `Promise.all` accepts an array of promises, and returns a new promise which
  is fulfilled with an array of fulfillment values for the passed promises, or
  rejected with the reason of the first passed promise to be rejected. It casts all
  elements of the passed iterable to promises as it runs this algorithm.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  import Promise, { resolve } from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = resolve(1);
  let promise2 = resolve(2);
  let promise3 = resolve(3);
  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];

  Promise.all(promises).then(function(array){
    // The array here would be [ 1, 2, 3 ];
  });
  ```

  If any of the `promises` given to `RSVP.all` are rejected, the first promise
  that is rejected will be given as an argument to the returned promises's
  rejection handler. For example:

  Example:

  ```javascript
  import Promise, { resolve, reject } from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = resolve(1);
  let promise2 = reject(new Error("2"));
  let promise3 = reject(new Error("3"));
  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];

  Promise.all(promises).then(function(array){
    // Code here never runs because there are rejected promises!
  }, function(error) {
    // error.message === "2"
  });
  ```

  @method all
  @for Promise
  @param {Array} entries array of promises
  @param {String} [label] optional string for labeling the promise.
  Useful for tooling.
  @return {Promise} promise that is fulfilled when all `promises` have been
  fulfilled, or rejected if any of them become rejected.
  @static
*/
function all$1(entries, label) {
  if (!Array.isArray(entries)) {
    return this.reject(new TypeError("Promise.all must be called with an array"), label);
  }
  return new Enumerator(this, entries, true /* abort on reject */, label).promise;
}

/**
  `Promise.race` returns a new promise which is settled in the same way as the
  first passed promise to settle.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  import Promise from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function(){
      resolve('promise 1');
    }, 200);
  });

  let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function(){
      resolve('promise 2');
    }, 100);
  });

  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){
    // result === 'promise 2' because it was resolved before promise1
    // was resolved.
  });
  ```

  `Promise.race` is deterministic in that only the state of the first
  settled promise matters. For example, even if other promises given to the
  `promises` array argument are resolved, but the first settled promise has
  become rejected before the other promises became fulfilled, the returned
  promise will become rejected:

  ```javascript
  import Promise from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function(){
      resolve('promise 1');
    }, 200);
  });

  let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function(){
      reject(new Error('promise 2'));
    }, 100);
  });

  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){
    // Code here never runs
  }, function(reason){
    // reason.message === 'promise 2' because promise 2 became rejected before
    // promise 1 became fulfilled
  });
  ```

  An example real-world use case is implementing timeouts:

  ```javascript
  import Promise from 'rsvp';

  Promise.race([ajax('foo.json'), timeout(5000)])
  ```

  @method race

  @static
  @param {Array} entries array of promises to observe
  @param {String} [label] optional string for describing the promise returned.

/**
  Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The
  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which
  registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason
  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.

  Terminology
  -----------

  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.
  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.
  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).
  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.
  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.
  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.

  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled
  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the
  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.

  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a
  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's
  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will
  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will
  itself fulfill.


  Basic Usage:
  ------------

  ```js
  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // on success
    resolve(value);

    // on failure
    reject(reason);
  });

  promise.then(function(value) {
    // on fulfillment
  }, function(reason) {
    // on rejection
  });
  ```

  Advanced Usage:
  ---------------

  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as
  `XMLHttpRequest`s.

  ```js
  function getJSON(url) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

      xhr.open('GET', url);
      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;
      xhr.responseType = 'json';
      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');
      xhr.send();

      function handler() {
        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {
          if (this.status === 200) {
            resolve(this.response);
          } else {
            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));
          }
        }
      };
    });
  }

  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {
    // on fulfillment
  }, function(reason) {
    // on rejection
  });
  ```

  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.

  ```js
  Promise.all([
    getJSON('/posts'),
    getJSON('/comments')
  ]).then(function(values){
    values[0] // => postsJSON
    values[1] // => commentsJSON

    return values;
  });
  ```

  @class Promise

  @param {function} resolver
  @param {String} [label] optional string for labeling the promise.

  @constructor
*/
let Promise$1 = class Promise {
  constructor(resolver, label) {
    this._id = counter++;
    this._label = label;
    this._state = undefined;
    this._result = undefined;
    this._subscribers = [];
    config.instrument && instrument('created', this);
    if (noop !== resolver) {
      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();
      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();
    }
  }
  _onError(reason) {
    config.after(() => {
      if (this._onError) {
        config.trigger('error', reason, this._label);
      }
    });
  }

  /**
    `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same
    as the catch block of a try/catch statement.

      throw new Error('couldn\'t find that author');
    }

    Useful for tooling.
    @return {Promise}
  */
  catch(onRejection, label) {
    return this.then(undefined, onRejection, label);
  }

  /**
    `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native
    try/catch/finally behaves

    ```js
    findAuthor() {

/**
  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,
  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the
  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.

  ```js
  findUser().then(function(user){
    // user is available
  }, function(reason){
    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why
  });
  ```

  Chaining
  --------

  The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'
  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment
  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.

  ```js
  findUser().then(function (user) {
    return user.name;
  }, function (reason) {
    return 'default name';
  }).then(function (userName) {
    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it
    // will be `'default name'`
  });

  findUser().then(function (user) {
    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');
  }, function (reason) {
    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we\'re unhappy');
  }).then(function (value) {
    // never reached
  }, function (reason) {
    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.
    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we\'re unhappy'.
  });
  ```
  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.

  ```js
  findUser().then(function (user) {
    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');
  }).then(function (value) {
    // never reached
  }).then(function (value) {
    // never reached
  }, function (reason) {
    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here
  });
  ```

  Assimilation
  ------------

  Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be
  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the
  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending
  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.

  ```js
  findUser().then(function (user) {
    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);
  }).then(function (comments) {
    // The user's comments are now available
  });
  ```

  If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.

  ```js
  findUser().then(function (user) {
    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);
  }).then(function (comments) {
    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here
  }, function (reason) {
    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here
  });
  ```

  Simple Example
  --------------

  Synchronous Example

  ```javascript
  let result;

  try {
    result = findResult();
    // success
  } catch(reason) {
    // failure
  }
  ```

  Errback Example

  ```js
  findResult(function(result, err){
    if (err) {
      // failure
    } else {
      // success
    }
  });
  ```

  Promise Example;

  ```javascript
  findResult().then(function(result){
    // success
  }, function(reason){
    // failure
  });
  ```

  Advanced Example
  --------------

  Synchronous Example

  ```javascript
  let author, books;

  try {
    author = findAuthor();
    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);
    // success
  } catch(reason) {
    // failure
  }
  ```

  Errback Example

  ```js

  function foundBooks(books) {

  }

  function failure(reason) {

  }

  findAuthor(function(author, err){
    if (err) {
      failure(err);
      // failure
    } else {
      try {
        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {

/**
  `denodeify` takes a 'node-style' function and returns a function that
  will return an `Promise`. You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the
  browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,
  `denodeify` transforms the following:

  ```javascript
  let fs = require('fs');

  fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){
    if (err) return handleError(err);
    handleData(data);
  });
  ```

  into:

  ```javascript
  let fs = require('fs');
  let readFile = denodeify(fs.readFile);

  readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);
  ```

  If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`
  just returns the first one:

  ```javascript
  let request = denodeify(require('request'));

  request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {
    // ...
  });
  ```

  However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s
  second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters
  as an array:

  ```javascript
  let request = denodeify(require('request'), true);

  request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {
    // result[0] -> res
    // result[1] -> body
  });
  ```

  Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:

  ```javascript
  let request = denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);

  request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {
    // result.res
    // result.body
  });
  ```

  Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:

  ```javascript
  let app = require('express')();
  let render = denodeify(app.render.bind(app));
  ```

  The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all
  environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original
  function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the
  denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:

  ```javascript
  let request = denodeify(require('request')),
      cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here

  request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {
    // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com
  });
  ```

  Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead
  of using callbacks. For example, instead of:

  ```javascript
  let fs = require('fs');

  fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){
    if (err) { ... } // Handle error
    fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){
      if (err) { ... } // Handle error
      console.log('done')
    });
  });
  ```

  you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:

  ```javascript
  let fs = require('fs');
  let readFile = denodeify(fs.readFile);
  let writeFile = denodeify(fs.writeFile);

  readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){
    return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);
  }).then(function(){
    console.log('done')
  }).catch(function(error){
    // Handle error
  });
  ```

/**
  `rethrow` will rethrow an error on the next turn of the JavaScript event
  loop in order to aid debugging.

  Promises A+ specifies that any exceptions that occur with a promise must be
  caught by the promises implementation and bubbled to the last handler. For
  this reason, it is recommended that you always specify a second rejection
  handler function to `then`. However, `rethrow` will throw the exception
  outside of the promise, so it bubbles up to your console if in the browser,
  or domain/cause uncaught exception in Node. `rethrow` will also throw the
  error again so the error can be handled by the promise per the spec.

  ```javascript
  import { rethrow } from 'rsvp';

  function throws(){
    throw new Error('Whoops!');
  }

  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    throws();
  });

  promise.catch(rethrow).then(function(){
    // Code here doesn't run because the promise became rejected due to an
    // error!
  }, function (err){
    // handle the error here
  });
  ```

  The 'Whoops' error will be thrown on the next turn of the event loop
  and you can watch for it in your console. You can also handle it using a
  rejection handler given to `.then` or `.catch` on the returned promise.

/**
 `map` is similar to JavaScript's native `map` method. `mapFn` is eagerly called
  meaning that as soon as any promise resolves its value will be passed to `mapFn`.
  `map` returns a promise that will become fulfilled with the result of running
  `mapFn` on the values the promises become fulfilled with.

  For example:

  ```javascript
  import { map, resolve } from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = resolve(1);
  let promise2 = resolve(2);
  let promise3 = resolve(3);
  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];

  let mapFn = function(item){
    return item + 1;
  };

  map(promises, mapFn).then(function(result){
    // result is [ 2, 3, 4 ]
  });
  ```

  If any of the `promises` given to `map` are rejected, the first promise
  that is rejected will be given as an argument to the returned promise's
  rejection handler. For example:

  ```javascript
  import { map, reject, resolve } from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = resolve(1);
  let promise2 = reject(new Error('2'));
  let promise3 = reject(new Error('3'));
  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];

  let mapFn = function(item){
    return item + 1;
  };

  map(promises, mapFn).then(function(array){
    // Code here never runs because there are rejected promises!
  }, function(reason) {
    // reason.message === '2'
  });
  ```

  `map` will also wait if a promise is returned from `mapFn`. For example,
  say you want to get all comments from a set of blog posts, but you need
  the blog posts first because they contain a url to those comments.

  ```javscript
  import { map } from 'rsvp';

  let mapFn = function(blogPost){
    // getComments does some ajax and returns an Promise that is fulfilled
    // with some comments data
    return getComments(blogPost.comments_url);
  };

  // getBlogPosts does some ajax and returns an Promise that is fulfilled
  // with some blog post data
  map(getBlogPosts(), mapFn).then(function(comments){
    // comments is the result of asking the server for the comments
    // of all blog posts returned from getBlogPosts()
  });
  ```

 `filter` is similar to JavaScript's native `filter` method.
 `filterFn` is eagerly called meaning that as soon as any promise
  resolves its value will be passed to `filterFn`. `filter` returns
  a promise that will become fulfilled with the result of running
  `filterFn` on the values the promises become fulfilled with.

  For example:

  let promise2 = resolve(2);

  ```

  If any of the `promises` given to `filter` are rejected, the first promise
  that is rejected will be given as an argument to the returned promise's
  rejection handler. For example:

  ```javascript
  import { filter, reject, resolve } from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = resolve(1);
  let promise2 = reject(new Error('2'));
  let promise3 = reject(new Error('3'));
  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];

    // Code here never runs because there are rejected promises!
  }, function(reason) {
    // reason.message === '2'
  });
  ```

  `filter` will also wait for any promises returned from `filterFn`.
  For instance, you may want to fetch a list of users then return a subset
  of those users based on some asynchronous operation:

  ```javascript
  import { filter, resolve } from 'rsvp';

  let alice = { name: 'alice' };
  let bob   = { name: 'bob' };
  let users = [ alice, bob ];

  let promises = users.map(function(user){

  };
  filter(promises, filterFn).then(function(users){
    // true, because the server told us only Alice can create a blog post.
    users.length === 1;
    // false, because Alice is the only user present in `users`

/**
  `CoreObject` is the base class for all Ember constructs. It establishes a
  class system based on Ember's Mixin system, and provides the basis for the
  Ember Object Model. `CoreObject` should generally not be used directly,
  instead you should use `EmberObject`.

  ## Usage

  You can define a class by extending from `CoreObject` using the `extend`
  method:

  ```js
  const Person = CoreObject.extend({
    name: 'Tomster',
  });
  ```

  For detailed usage, see the [Object Model](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/object-model/)
  section of the guides.

  ## Usage with Native Classes

  Native JavaScript `class` syntax can be used to extend from any `CoreObject`
  based class:

  ```js
  class Person extends CoreObject {
    init() {
      super.init(...arguments);
      this.name = 'Tomster';
    }
  }
  ```

  Some notes about `class` usage:

  * `new` syntax is not currently supported with classes that extend from
    `EmberObject` or `CoreObject`. You must continue to use the `create` method
    when making new instances of classes, even if they are defined using native
    class syntax. If you want to use `new` syntax, consider creating classes
    which do _not_ extend from `EmberObject` or `CoreObject`. Ember features,
    such as computed properties and decorators, will still work with base-less
    classes.
  * Instead of using `this._super()`, you must use standard `super` syntax in
    native classes. See the [MDN docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Super_class_calls_with_super)
    for more details.
  * Native classes support using [constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Constructor)
    to set up newly-created instances. Ember uses these to, among other things,
    support features that need to retrieve other entities by name, like Service
    injection and `getOwner`. To ensure your custom instance setup logic takes
    place after this important work is done, avoid using the `constructor` in
    favor of `init`.
  * Properties passed to `create` will be available on the instance by the time
    `init` runs, so any code that requires these values should work at that
    time.
  * Using native classes, and switching back to the old Ember Object model is
    fully supported.

  /**
    Defines the properties that will be concatenated from the superclass
    (instead of overridden).
     By default, when you extend an Ember class a property defined in
    the subclass overrides a property with the same name that is defined
    in the superclass. However, there are some cases where it is preferable
    to build up a property's value by combining the superclass' property
    value with the subclass' value. An example of this in use within Ember
    is the `classNames` property of `Component` from `@ember/component`.
     Here is some sample code showing the difference between a concatenated
    property and a normal one:
     ```javascript
    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';
     const Bar = EmberObject.extend({
      // Configure which properties to concatenate
      concatenatedProperties: ['concatenatedProperty'],
       someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['bar'],
      concatenatedProperty: ['bar']
    });
     const FooBar = Bar.extend({
      someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['foo'],
      concatenatedProperty: ['foo']
    });
     let fooBar = FooBar.create();
    fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['foo']
    fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo']
    ```
     This behavior extends to object creation as well. Continuing the
    above example:
     ```javascript
    let fooBar = FooBar.create({
      someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['baz'],
      concatenatedProperty: ['baz']
    })
    fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['baz']
    fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']
    ```
     Adding a single property that is not an array will just add it in the array:
     ```javascript
    let fooBar = FooBar.create({
      concatenatedProperty: 'baz'
    })
    view.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']
    ```
     Using the `concatenatedProperties` property, we can tell Ember to mix the
    content of the properties.
     In `Component` the `classNames`, `classNameBindings` and
    `attributeBindings` properties are concatenated.
     This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,
    although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently. Since
    it changes expectations about behavior of properties, you should properly
    document its usage in each individual concatenated property (to not
    mislead your users to think they can override the property in a subclass).
     @property concatenatedProperties
    @type Array
    @default null
    @public
  */

  /**
    Defines the properties that will be merged from the superclass
    (instead of overridden).
     By default, when you extend an Ember class a property defined in
    the subclass overrides a property with the same name that is defined
    in the superclass. However, there are some cases where it is preferable
    to build up a property's value by merging the superclass property value
    with the subclass property's value. An example of this in use within Ember
    is the `queryParams` property of routes.
     Here is some sample code showing the difference between a merged
    property and a normal one:
     ```javascript
    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';
     const Bar = EmberObject.extend({
      // Configure which properties are to be merged
      mergedProperties: ['mergedProperty'],
       someNonMergedProperty: {
        nonMerged: 'superclass value of nonMerged'
      },
      mergedProperty: {
        page: { replace: false },
        limit: { replace: true }
      }
    });
     const FooBar = Bar.extend({
      someNonMergedProperty: {
        completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged'
      },
      mergedProperty: {
        limit: { replace: false }
      }
    });
     let fooBar = FooBar.create();
     fooBar.get('someNonMergedProperty');
    // => { completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged' }
    //
    // Note the entire object, including the nonMerged property of
    // the superclass object, has been replaced
     fooBar.get('mergedProperty');
    // => {
    //   page: {replace: false},
    //   limit: {replace: false}
    // }
    //
    // Note the page remains from the superclass, and the
    // `limit` property's value of `false` has been merged from
    // the subclass.
    ```
     This behavior is not available during object `create` calls. It is only
    available at `extend` time.
     In `Route` the `queryParams` property is merged.
     This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,
    although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently. Since
    it changes expectations about behavior of properties, you should properly

  /**
    Creates a new subclass.
     ```javascript
    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';
     const Person = EmberObject.extend({
      say(thing) {
        alert(thing);
       }
    });
    ```
     This defines a new subclass of EmberObject: `Person`. It contains one method: `say()`.
     You can also create a subclass from any existing class by calling its `extend()` method.
    For example, you might want to create a subclass of Ember's built-in `Component` class:
     ```javascript
    import Component from '@ember/component';
     const PersonComponent = Component.extend({
      tagName: 'li',
      classNameBindings: ['isAdministrator']
    });
    ```
     When defining a subclass, you can override methods but still access the
    implementation of your parent class by calling the special `_super()` method:
     ```javascript
    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';
     const Person = EmberObject.extend({
      say(thing) {
        let name = this.get('name');
        alert(`${name} says: ${thing}`);
      }
    });
     const Soldier = Person.extend({
      say(thing) {
        this._super(`${thing}, sir!`);
      },
      march(numberOfHours) {
        alert(`${this.get('name')} marches for ${numberOfHours} hours.`);
      }
    });
     let yehuda = Soldier.create({
      name: 'Yehuda Katz'
    });
     yehuda.say('Yes');  // alerts "Yehuda Katz says: Yes, sir!"
    ```
     The `create()` on line #17 creates an *instance* of the `Soldier` class.
    The `extend()` on line #8 creates a *subclass* of `Person`. Any instance
    of the `Person` class will *not* have the `march()` method.
     You can also pass `Mixin` classes to add additional properties to the subclass.
     ```javascript
    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';
    import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';
     const Person = EmberObject.extend({
      say(thing) {
        alert(`${this.get('name')} says: ${thing}`);
      }
    });
     const SingingMixin = Mixin.create({
      sing(thing) {
        alert(`${this.get('name')} sings: la la la ${thing}`);
      }
    });
     const BroadwayStar = Person.extend(SingingMixin, {
      dance() {
        alert(`${this.get('name')} dances: tap tap tap tap `);
      }
    });
    ```
     The `BroadwayStar` class contains three methods: `say()`, `sing()`, and `dance()`.

/**
  The purpose of the Ember Instrumentation module is
  to provide efficient, general-purpose instrumentation
  for Ember.

  Subscribe to a listener by using `subscribe`:

  ```javascript
  import { subscribe } from '@ember/instrumentation';

  subscribe("render", {
    before(name, timestamp, payload) {

    },

    after(name, timestamp, payload) {

    }
  });
  ```

  If you return a value from the `before` callback, that same
  value will be passed as a fourth parameter to the `after`
  callback.

  Instrument a block of code by using `instrument`:

  ```javascript
  import { instrument } from '@ember/instrumentation';

  instrument("render.handlebars", payload, function() {
    // rendering logic
  }, binding);
  ```

  Event names passed to `instrument` are namespaced
  by periods, from more general to more specific. Subscribers
  can listen for events by whatever level of granularity they
  are interested in.

  In the above example, the event is `render.handlebars`,
  and the subscriber listened for all events beginning with
  `render`. It would receive callbacks for events named
  `render`, `render.handlebars`, `render.container`, or
  even `render.handlebars.layout`.

/**
  This mixin implements Observer-friendly Array-like behavior. It is not a
  concrete implementation, but it can be used up by other classes that want
  to appear like arrays.

  For example, ArrayProxy is a concrete class that can be instantiated to
  implement array-like behavior. This class uses the Array Mixin by way of
  the MutableArray mixin, which allows observable changes to be made to the
  underlying array.

  This mixin defines methods specifically for collections that provide
  index-ordered access to their contents. When you are designing code that
  needs to accept any kind of Array-like object, you should use these methods
  instead of Array primitives because these will properly notify observers of
  changes to the array.

  Although these methods are efficient, they do add a layer of indirection to
  your application so it is a good idea to use them only when you need the
  flexibility of using both true JavaScript arrays and "virtual" arrays such
  as controllers and collections.

  You can use the methods defined in this module to access and modify array
  contents in an observable-friendly way. You can also be notified whenever
  the membership of an array changes by using `.observes('myArray.[]')`.

  To support `EmberArray` in your own class, you must override two
  primitives to use it: `length()` and `objectAt()`.

/**
  `@dependentKeyCompat` is decorator that can be used on _native getters_ that
  use tracked properties. It exposes the getter to Ember's classic computed
  property and observer systems, so they can watch it for changes. It can be
  used in both native and classic classes.

  Native Example:

  ```js
  import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
  import { dependentKeyCompat } from '@ember/object/compat';
  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  class Person {
    @tracked firstName;
    @tracked lastName;

    @dependentKeyCompat
    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
  }

  class Profile {
    constructor(person) {
      set(this, 'person', person);
    }

    @computed('person.fullName')
    get helloMessage() {
      return `Hello, ${this.person.fullName}!`;
    }
  }
  ```

  Classic Example:

  ```js
  import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
  import { dependentKeyCompat } from '@ember/object/compat';
  import EmberObject, { computed, observer, set } from '@ember/object';

  const Person = EmberObject.extend({
    firstName: tracked(),
    lastName: tracked(),

    fullName: dependentKeyCompat(function() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }),
  });

  const Profile = EmberObject.extend({
    person: null,

    helloMessage: computed('person.fullName', function() {
      return `Hello, ${this.person.fullName}!`;
    }),

    onNameUpdated: observer('person.fullName', function() {
      console.log('person name updated!');
    }),
  });
  ```

  `dependentKeyCompat()` can receive a getter function or an object containing
  `get`/`set` methods when used in classic classes, like computed properties.

  In general, only properties which you _expect_ to be watched by older,
  untracked clases should be marked as dependency compatible. The decorator is
  meant as an interop layer for parts of Ember's older classic APIs, and should
  not be applied to every possible getter/setter in classes. The number of
  dependency compatible getters should be _minimized_ wherever possible. New
  application code should not need to use `@dependentKeyCompat`, since it is
  only for interoperation with older code.

     1) A decision can be made to redirect elsewhere without
       needing to resolve the model first.
    2) Any async operations need to occur first before the
       model is attempted to be resolved.
     This hook is provided the current `transition` attempt
    as a parameter, which can be used to `.abort()` the transition,
    save it for a later `.retry()`, or retrieve values set
    on it from a previous hook. You can also just call
    `router.transitionTo` to another route to implicitly
    abort the `transition`.
     You can return a promise from this hook to pause the

    but is provided the route's resolved model in addition to
    the `transition`, and is therefore suited to performing
    logic that can only take place after the model has already
    resolved.

     `redirect` and `afterModel` behave very similarly and are

    distinction when calling `this.router.transitionTo` to a child route
    of the current route. From `afterModel`, this new transition
    invalidates the current transition, causing `beforeModel`,

    entry into this route are considered fully validated.

     Router.map(function() {
      this.route('post', { path: '/posts/:post_id' });
    });
     export default Router;
    ```
     Note that for routes with dynamic segments, this hook is not always
    executed. If the route is entered through a transition (e.g. when
    using the `link-to` Handlebars helper or the `transitionTo` method
    of routes), and a model context is already provided this hook
    is not called.
     A model context does not include a primitive string or number,
    which does cause the model hook to be called.
     Routes without dynamic segments will always execute the model hook.
     ```javascript
    // no dynamic segment, model hook always called
    this.router.transitionTo('posts');
     // model passed in, so model hook not called
    thePost = store.findRecord('post', 1);
    this.router.transitionTo('post', thePost);
     // integer passed in, model hook is called
    this.router.transitionTo('post', 1);
     // model id passed in, model hook is called
    // useful for forcing the hook to execute
    thePost = store.findRecord('post', 1);
    this.router.transitionTo('post', thePost.id);
    ```
     This hook follows the asynchronous/promise semantics
    described in the documentation for `beforeModel`. In particular,
    if a promise returned from `model` fails, the error will be
    handled by the `error` hook on `Route`.
     Note that the legacy behavior of automatically defining a model
    hook when a dynamic segment ending in `_id` is present is
    [deprecated](https://deprecations.emberjs.com/v5.x#toc_deprecate-implicit-route-model).
    You should explicitly define a model hook whenever any segments are

  /**
    A hook you can use to setup the controller for the current route.
     This method is called with the controller for the current route and the
    model supplied by the `model` hook.
     By default, the `setupController` hook sets the `model` property of
    the controller to the specified `model` when it is not `undefined`.
     If you implement the `setupController` hook in your Route, it will
    prevent this default behavior. If you want to preserve that behavior
    when implementing your `setupController` function, make sure to call
    `super`:
     ```app/routes/photos.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
    import { service } from '@ember/service';
     export default class PhotosRoute extends Route {
      @service store;
       model() {
        return this.store.findAll('photo');
      }
       setupController(controller, model) {
        super.setupController(controller, model);
         this.controllerFor('application').set('showingPhotos', true);
      }
    }
    ```
     The provided controller will be one resolved based on the name
    of this route.
     If no explicit controller is defined, Ember will automatically create one.
     As an example, consider the router:
     ```app/router.js
    // ...
     Router.map(function() {
      this.route('post', { path: '/posts/:post_id' });
    });
     export default Router;
    ```
     If you have defined a file for the post controller,
    the framework will use it.
    If it is not defined, a basic `Controller` instance would be used.
     @example Behavior of a basic Controller
     ```app/routes/post.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
     export default class PostRoute extends Route {
      setupController(controller, model) {

  which routes are newly active, and which routes remain
  active but have their context changed.
     Take a list of old routes and new routes and partition
  them into four buckets:
     * unchanged: the route was active in both the old and
    new URL, and its context remains the same
  * updated context: the route was active in both the
    old and new URL, but its context changed. The route's
    `setup` method, if any, will be called with the new
    context.
  * exited: the route was active in the old URL, but is
    no longer active.
  * entered: the route was not active in the old URL, but
    is now active.

     * `updatedContext`: a list of `RouteInfo` objects that
    represent routes that remain active but have a changed
    context
  * `entered`: a list of `RouteInfo` objects that represent
    routes that are newly active
  * `exited`: a list of `RouteInfo` objects that are no
    longer active.
  * `unchanged`: a list of `RouteInfo` objects that remain active.
     @param {Array[InternalRouteInfo]} oldRoutes a list of the route
    information for the previous URL (or `[]` if this is the
    first handled transition)
  @param {Array[InternalRouteInfo]} newRoutes a list of the route

    The `Router.map` function allows you to define mappings from URLs to routes
    in your application. These mappings are defined within the
    supplied callback function using `this.route`.
     The first parameter is the name of the route which is used by default as the
    path name as well.
     The second parameter is the optional options hash. Available options are:
       * `path`: allows you to provide your own path as well as mark dynamic
        segments.
      * `resetNamespace`: false by default; when nesting routes, ember will
        combine the route names to form the fully-qualified route name, which is
        used with `{{link-to}}` or manually transitioning to routes. Setting
        `resetNamespace: true` will cause the route not to inherit from its
        parent route's names. This is handy for preventing extremely long route names.
        Keep in mind that the actual URL path behavior is still retained.
     The third parameter is a function, which can be used to nest routes.
    Nested routes, by default, will have the parent route tree's route name and
    path prepended to it's own.

/*
  To add a deprecation, you must add a new entry to the `DEPRECATIONS` object.
  The entry should be an object with the following properties:

  * `id` (required): A string that uniquely identifies the deprecation. This
    should be a short, descriptive name, typically dasherized.
  * `for` (required): The string `ember-source` -- every deprecation from this
    package is for `ember-source`.
  * `since` (required): An object with `available` and `enabled`. `available` is
    the first version of Ember that the deprecation is available in. `enabled` is
    the version of Ember that the deprecation was first enabled. This is used as
    a feature flag deprecations. For public APIs, the `enabled` value is added
    only once the deprecation RFC is [Ready for Release](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs#ready-for-release).
  * `until` (required): The version of Ember that the deprecation will be removed
  * `url` (required): A URL to the deprecation guide for the deprecation. This
    URL can be constructed in advance of the deprecation being added to the
    [deprecation app](https://github.com/ember-learn/deprecation-app) by
    following this format: `https://deprecations.emberjs.com/deprecations/{{id}}`.

  For example:
  `deprecate` should then be called using the entry from the `DEPRECATIONS` object.

  ```ts
  import { DEPRECATIONS } from '@ember/-internals/deprecations';
  //...

  deprecateUntil(message, DEPRECATIONS.MY_DEPRECATION);
  ```

  `expectDeprecation` should also use the DEPRECATIONS object, but it should be noted
  that it uses `isEnabled` instead of `test` because the expectations of `expectDeprecation`
  are the opposite of `test`.

  ```ts
  expectDeprecation(
    () => {
        assert.equal(foo, bar(), 'foo is equal to bar'); // something that triggers the deprecation
    },
    /matchesMessage/,
    DEPRECATIONS.MY_DEPRECATION.isEnabled
  );
  ```

  Tests can be conditionally run based on whether a deprecation is enabled or not:

  ```ts
    [`${testUnless(DEPRECATIONS.MY_DEPRECATION.isRemoved)} specific deprecated feature tested only in this test`]
  ```

  This test will be skipped when the MY_DEPRECATION is removed.
  When adding a deprecation, we need to guard all the code that will eventually be removed, including tests.
  For tests that are not specifically testing the deprecated feature, we need to figure out how to
  test the behavior without encountering the deprecated feature, just as users would.

     This is most commonly used to manage redirects in a way that does not cause confusing additions

     ```app/routes/contact-form.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing';
    import { service } from '@ember/service';
     export default class extends Route {
      @service router;
       activate() {
        this.router.on('routeWillChange', (transition) => {
          if (!transition.to.find(route => route.name === this.routeName)) {
            alert("Please save or cancel your changes.");
            transition.abort();
          }
        })
      }
    }
    ```
     The `routeWillChange` event fires whenever a new route is chosen as the desired target of a transition. This includes `transitionTo`, `replaceWith`, all redirection for any reason including error handling, and abort. Aborting implies changing the desired target back to where you already were. Once a transition has completed, `routeDidChange` fires.
     @event routeWillChange
    @param {Transition} transition
    @public
  */

  /**
    The `routeDidChange` event only fires once a transition has settled.
    This includes aborts and error substates. Like the `routeWillChange` event
    it receives a Transition as the sole argument.
     A good example is sending some analytics when the route has transitioned:
     ```app/routes/contact-form.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing';
    import { service } from '@ember/service';
     export default class extends Route {
      @service router;
       activate() {
        this.router.on('routeDidChange', (transition) => {
          ga.send('pageView', {
            current: transition.to.name,
            from: transition.from.name
          });
        })
      }
    }
    ```
     `routeDidChange` will be called after any `Route`'s
    [didTransition](/ember/release/classes/Route/events/didTransition?anchor=didTransition)
    action has been fired.
    The updates of properties
    [currentURL](/ember/release/classes/RouterService/properties/currentURL?anchor=currentURL),
    [currentRouteName](/ember/release/classes/RouterService/properties/currentURL?anchor=currentRouteName)
    and
    [currentRoute](/ember/release/classes/RouterService/properties/currentURL?anchor=currentRoute)
    are completed at the time `routeDidChange` is called.
     @event routeDidChange
    @param {Transition} transition
    @public
  */

/**
 * A convenience for pushing some arguments on the stack and
 * running some code if the code needs to be re-executed during
 * updating execution if some of the arguments have changed.
 *
 * # Initial Execution
 *
 * The `args` function should push zero or more arguments onto
 * the stack and return the number of arguments pushed.
 *
 * The `body` function provides the instructions to execute both
 * during initial execution and during updating execution.
 *
 * Internally, this function starts by pushing a new frame, so
 * that the body can return and sets the return point ($ra) to
 * the ENDINITIAL label.
 *
 * It then executes the `args` function, which adds instructions
 * responsible for pushing the arguments for the block to the
 * stack. These arguments will be restored to the stack before
 * updating execution.
 *
 * Next, it adds the Enter opcode, which marks the current position
 * in the DOM, and remembers the current $pc (the next instruction)
 * as the first instruction to execute during updating execution.
 *
 * Next, it runs `body`, which adds the opcodes that should
 * execute both during initial execution and during updating execution.
 * If the `body` wishes to finish early, it should Jump to the
 * `FINALLY` label.
 *
 * Next, it adds the FINALLY label, followed by:
 *
 * - the Exit opcode, which finalizes the marked DOM started by the
 *   Enter opcode.
 * - the Return opcode, which returns to the current return point
 *   ($ra).
 *
 * Finally, it adds the ENDINITIAL label followed by the PopFrame
 * instruction, which restores $fp, $sp and $ra.
 *
 * # Updating Execution
 *
 * Updating execution for this `replayable` occurs if the `body` added an
 * assertion, via one of the `JumpIf`, `JumpUnless` or `AssertSame` opcodes.
 *
 * If, during updating executon, the assertion fails, the initial VM is
 * restored, and the stored arguments are pushed onto the stack. The DOM
 * between the starting and ending markers is cleared, and the VM's cursor
 * is set to the area just cleared.
 *
 * The return point ($ra) is set to -1, the exit instruction.
 *
 * Finally, the $pc is set to to the instruction saved off by the
 * Enter opcode during initial execution, and execution proceeds as
 * usual.
 *
 * The only difference is that when a `Return` instruction is
 * encountered, the program jumps to -1 rather than the END label,
 * and the PopFrame opcode is not needed.

 * The Program Heap is responsible for dynamically allocating

 * regions of the memory in an int array known as the table.
 *
 * The table 32-bit aligned and has the following layout:
 *
 * | ... | hp (u32) |       info (u32)   | size (u32) |
 * | ... |  Handle  | Scope Size | State | Size       |
 * | ... | 32bits   | 30bits     | 2bits | 32bit      |
 *
 * With this information we effectively have the ability to
 * control when we want to free memory. That being said you
 * can not free during execution as raw address are only
 * valid during the execution. This means you cannot close
 * over them as you will have a bad memory access exception.

/**
  This utility function is used to declare a given component has no backing class. When the rendering engine detects this it
  is able to perform a number of optimizations. Templates that are associated with `templateOnly()` will be rendered _as is_
  without adding a wrapping `<div>` (or any of the other element customization behaviors of [@ember/component](/ember/release/classes/Component)).
  Specifically, this means that the template will be rendered as "outer HTML".

  In general, this method will be used by build time tooling and would not be directly written in an application. However,
  at times it may be useful to use directly to leverage the "outer HTML" semantics mentioned above. For example, if an addon would like
  to use these semantics for its templates but cannot be certain it will only be consumed by applications that have enabled the
  `template-only-glimmer-components` optional feature.

  @example

  ```js
  import { templateOnlyComponent } from '@glimmer/runtime';

  export default templateOnlyComponent();
  ```

  @public
  @method templateOnly
  @param {String} moduleName the module name that the template only component represents, this will be used for debugging purposes

//           present but throws an exception on IE and Edge. Old versions of
//           Firefox create nodes in the incorrect namespace.
// Fix:      Since IE and Edge silently fail to create SVG nodes using
//           innerHTML, and because Firefox may create nodes in the incorrect
//           namespace using innerHTML on SVG elements, an HTML-string wrapping
//           approach is used. A pre/post SVG tag is added to the string, then
//           that whole string is added to a div. The created nodes are plucked
//           out and applied to the target location on DOM.

  //           with proper behavior will populate div.childNodes with two items.
  //           These browsers will populate it with one merged node instead.
  // Fix:      Add these nodes to a wrapper element, then iterate the childNodes
  //           of that wrapper and move the nodes to their target location. Note
  //           that potential SVG bugs will have been handled before this fix.
  //           Note that this fix must only apply to the previous text node, as

      Dynamically look up a property on an object. The second argument to `{{get}}`
      should have a string value, although it can be bound.

      If there were several facts about a person, the `{{get}}` helper can dynamically
      pick one:
      ```app/templates/application.hbs
      <DeveloperDetail @factName="language" />
      ```
      ```handlebars
      {{get this.developer @factName}}
      ```
      For a more complex example, this template would allow the user to switch
      between showing the user's height and weight with a click:
      ```app/components/developer-detail.js
      import Component from '@glimmer/component';
      import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
      export default class extends Component {
      @tracked developer = {
      name: "Sandi Metz",
      language: "Ruby"
      }
      @tracked currentFact = 'name'
      showFact = (fact) => {
      this.currentFact = fact;
      }
      }
      ```
      ```app/components/developer-detail.js
      {{get this.developer this.currentFact}}
      <button {{on 'click' (fn this.showFact "name")}}>Show name</button>
      <button {{on 'click' (fn this.showFact "language")}}>Show language</button>
      ```
      The `{{get}}` helper can also respect mutable values itself. For example:
      ```app/components/developer-detail.js
      <Input @value={{mut (get this.person this.currentFact)}} />
      <button {{on 'click' (fn this.showFact "name")}}>Show name</button>
      <button {{on 'click' (fn this.showFact "language")}}>Show language</button>
      ```
      Would allow the user to swap what fact is being displayed, and also edit
      that fact via a two-way mutable binding.

      The `{{on}}` modifier lets you easily add event listeners (it uses
      [EventTarget.addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
      internally).
      For example, if you'd like to run a function on your component when a `<button>`
      in the components template is clicked you might do something like:
      ```app/components/like-post.hbs
      <button {{on 'click' this.saveLike}}>Like this post!</button>
      ```
      ```app/components/like-post.js
      import Component from '@glimmer/component';
      import { action } from '@ember/object';
      export default class LikePostComponent extends Component {
      saveLike = () => {
      // someone likes your post!
      // better send a request off to your server...
      }
      }
      ```
      ### Arguments
      `{{on}}` accepts two positional arguments, and a few named arguments.
      The positional arguments are:
      - `event` -- the name to use when calling `addEventListener`
      - `callback` -- the function to be passed to `addEventListener`
      The named arguments are:
      - capture -- a `true` value indicates that events of this type will be dispatched
      to the registered listener before being dispatched to any EventTarget beneath it
      in the DOM tree.
      - once -- indicates that the listener should be invoked at most once after being
      added. If true, the listener would be automatically removed when invoked.
      - passive -- if `true`, indicates that the function specified by listener will never
      call preventDefault(). If a passive listener does call preventDefault(), the user
      agent will do nothing other than generate a console warning. See
      [Improving scrolling performance with passive listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#Improving_scrolling_performance_with_passive_listeners)
      to learn more.
      The callback function passed to `{{on}}` will receive any arguments that are passed
      to the event handler. Most commonly this would be the `event` itself.
      If you would like to pass additional arguments to the function you should use
      the `{{fn}}` helper.
      For example, in our example case above if you'd like to pass in the post that
      was being liked when the button is clicked you could do something like:
      ```app/components/like-post.hbs
      <button {{on 'click' (fn this.saveLike @post)}}>Like this post!</button>
      ```
      In this case, the `saveLike` function will receive two arguments: the click event
      and the value of `@post`.
      ### Function Context
      In the example above, we used an arrow function to ensure that `likePost` is
      properly bound to the `items-list`, but let's explore what happens if we
      left out the arrow function:
      ```app/components/like-post.js
      import Component from '@glimmer/component';
      export default class LikePostComponent extends Component {
      saveLike() {
      // ...snip...
      }
      }
      ```
      In this example, when the button is clicked `saveLike` will be invoked,
      it will **not** have access to the component instance. In other
      words, it will have no `this` context, so please make sure your functions
      are bound (via an arrow function or other means) before passing into `on`!

/**
  The `Input` component lets you create an HTML `<input>` element.

  ```handlebars
  <Input @value="987" />
  ```

  creates an `<input>` element with `type="text"` and value set to 987.

  ### Text field

  If no `type` argument is specified, a default of type 'text' is used.

  ```handlebars
  Search:
  <Input @value={{this.searchWord}} />
  ```

  In this example, the initial value in the `<input>` will be set to the value of
  `this.searchWord`. If the user changes the text, the value of `this.searchWord` will also be
  updated.

  ### Actions

  The `Input` component takes a number of arguments with callbacks that are invoked in response to
  user events.

  * `enter`
  * `insert-newline`
  * `escape-press`
  * `focus-in`
  * `focus-out`
  * `key-down`
  * `key-press`
  * `key-up`

  These callbacks are passed to `Input` like this:

  ```handlebars
  <Input @value={{this.searchWord}} @enter={{this.query}} />
  ```

  Starting with Ember Octane, we recommend using the `{{on}}` modifier to call actions
  on specific events, such as the input event.

  ```handlebars
  <label for="input-name">Name:</label>
  <Input
    @id="input-name"
    @value={{this.name}}
    {{on "input" this.validateName}}
  />
  ```

  The event name (e.g. `focusout`, `input`, `keydown`) always follows the casing
  that the HTML standard uses.

  ### `<input>` HTML Attributes to Avoid

  In most cases, if you want to pass an attribute to the underlying HTML `<input>` element, you
  can pass the attribute directly, just like any other Ember component.

  ```handlebars
  <Input @type="text" size="10" />
  ```

  In this example, the `size` attribute will be applied to the underlying `<input>` element in the
  outputted HTML.

  However, there are a few attributes where you **must** use the `@` version.

  * `@type`: This argument is used to control which Ember component is used under the hood
  * `@value`: The `@value` argument installs a two-way binding onto the element. If you wanted a
    one-way binding, use `<input>` with the `value` property and the `input` event instead.
  * `@checked` (for checkboxes): like `@value`, the `@checked` argument installs a two-way binding
    onto the element. If you wanted a one-way binding, use `<input type="checkbox">` with
    `checked` and the `input` event instead.

  ### Checkbox

  To create an `<input type="checkbox">`:

  ```handlebars
  Emberize Everything:
  <Input @type="checkbox" @checked={{this.isEmberized}} name="isEmberized" />
  ```

  This will bind the checked state of this checkbox to the value of `isEmberized` -- if either one
  changes, it will be reflected in the other.

/**
  The `LinkTo` component renders a link to the supplied `routeName` passing an optionally
  supplied model to the route as its `model` context of the route. The block for `LinkTo`
  becomes the contents of the rendered element:

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery'>
    Great Hamster Photos
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  This will result in:

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos">
    Great Hamster Photos
  </a>
  ```

  ### Disabling the `LinkTo` component

  The `LinkTo` component can be disabled by using the `disabled` argument. A disabled link
  doesn't result in a transition when activated, and adds the `disabled` class to the `<a>`
  element.

  (The class name to apply to the element can be overridden by using the `disabledClass`
  argument)

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @disabled={{true}}>
    Great Hamster Photos
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  ### Handling `href`

  `<LinkTo>` will use your application's Router to fill the element's `href` property with a URL
  that matches the path to the supplied `routeName`.

  ### Handling current route

  The `LinkTo` component will apply a CSS class name of 'active' when the application's current
  route matches the supplied routeName. For example, if the application's current route is
  'photoGallery.recent', then the following invocation of `LinkTo`:

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.recent'>
    Great Hamster Photos
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  will result in

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos/this-week" class="active">
    Great Hamster Photos
  </a>
  ```

  The CSS class used for active classes can be customized by passing an `activeClass` argument:

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.recent' @activeClass="current-url">
    Great Hamster Photos
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos/this-week" class="current-url">
    Great Hamster Photos
  </a>
  ```

  ### Keeping a link active for other routes

  If you need a link to be 'active' even when it doesn't match the current route, you can use the
  `current-when` argument.

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @current-when='photos'>
    Photo Gallery
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  This may be helpful for keeping links active for:

  * non-nested routes that are logically related
  * some secondary menu approaches
  * 'top navigation' with 'sub navigation' scenarios

  A link will be active if `current-when` is `true` or the current
  route is the route this link would transition to.

  To match multiple routes 'space-separate' the routes:

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='gallery' @current-when='photos drawings paintings'>
    Art Gallery
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  ### Supplying a model

  An optional `model` argument can be used for routes whose
  paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become
  the model context of the linked route:

  ```javascript
  Router.map(function() {
    this.route("photoGallery", {path: "hamster-photos/:photo_id"});
  });
  ```

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @model={{this.aPhoto}}>
    {{aPhoto.title}}
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos/42">
    Tomster
  </a>
  ```

  ### Supplying multiple models

  For deep-linking to route paths that contain multiple
  dynamic segments, the `models` argument can be used.

  As the router transitions through the route path, each
  supplied model argument will become the context for the
  route with the dynamic segments:

  ```javascript
  Router.map(function() {
    this.route("photoGallery", { path: "hamster-photos/:photo_id" }, function() {
      this.route("comment", {path: "comments/:comment_id"});
    });
  });
  ```

  This argument will become the model context of the linked route:

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.comment' @models={{array this.aPhoto this.comment}}>
    {{comment.body}}
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos/42/comments/718">
    A+++ would snuggle again.
  </a>
  ```

  ### Supplying an explicit dynamic segment value

  If you don't have a model object available to pass to `LinkTo`,
  an optional string or integer argument can be passed for routes whose
  paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become the value
  of the dynamic segment:

  ```javascript
  Router.map(function() {
    this.route("photoGallery", { path: "hamster-photos/:photo_id" });
  });
  ```

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @model={{aPhotoId}}>
    {{this.aPhoto.title}}
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos/42">
    Tomster
  </a>
  ```

  When transitioning into the linked route, the `model` hook will
  be triggered with parameters including this passed identifier.

  ### Supplying query parameters

  If you need to add optional key-value pairs that appear to the right of the ? in a URL,
  you can use the `query` argument.

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @query={{hash page=1 per_page=20}}>
    Great Hamster Photos
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  This will result in:

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos?page=1&per_page=20">
    Great Hamster Photos
  </a>
  ```

// A zero-runtime-overhead private symbol to use in branding the component to

/**
  A component is a reusable UI element that consists of a `.hbs` template and an
  optional JavaScript class that defines its behavior. For example, someone
  might make a `button` in the template and handle the click behavior in the
  JavaScript file that shares the same name as the template.

  Components are broken down into two categories:

  - Components _without_ JavaScript, that are based only on a template. These
    are called Template-only or TO components.
  - Components _with_ JavaScript, which consist of a template and a backing
    class.

  Ember ships with two types of JavaScript classes for components:

  1. Glimmer components, imported from `@glimmer/component`, which are the
     default component's for Ember Octane (3.15) and more recent editions.
  2. Classic components, imported from `@ember/component`, which were the
     default for older editions of Ember (pre 3.15).

  Below is the documentation for Classic components. If you are looking for the
  API documentation for Template-only or Glimmer components, it is [available
  here](/ember/release/modules/@glimmer%2Fcomponent).

  ## Defining a Classic Component

  If you want to customize the component in order to handle events, transform
  arguments or maintain internal state, you implement a subclass of `Component`.

  One example is to add computed properties to your component:

  ```app/components/person-profile.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    @computed('person.title', 'person.firstName', 'person.lastName')
    get displayName() {
      let { title, firstName, lastName } = this.person;

      if (title) {
        return `${title} ${lastName}`;
      } else {
        return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  And then use it in the component's template:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{this.displayName}}</h1>
  {{yield}}
  ```

  ## Customizing a Classic Component's HTML Element in JavaScript

  ### HTML Tag

  The default HTML tag name used for a component's HTML representation is `div`.
  This can be customized by setting the `tagName` property.

  Consider the following component class:

  ```app/components/emphasized-paragraph.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'em';
  }
  ```

  When invoked, this component would produce output that looks something like
  this:

  ```html
  <em id="ember1" class="ember-view"></em>
  ```

  ### HTML `class` Attribute

  The HTML `class` attribute of a component's tag can be set by providing a
  `classNames` property that is set to an array of strings:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNames = ['my-class', 'my-other-class'];
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce output that looks like this:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view my-class my-other-class"></div>
  ```

  `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings`
  property set to an array of properties names for the component. The return
  value of these properties will be added as part of the value for the
  components's `class` attribute. These properties can be computed properties:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';
  import { computed } from '@ember/object';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNames = ['my-class', 'my-other-class'];
    classNameBindings = ['propertyA', 'propertyB'];

    propertyA = 'from-a';

    get propertyB {
      if (someLogic) { return 'from-b'; }
    }
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view my-class my-other-class from-a from-b"></div>
  ```

  Note that `classNames` and `classNameBindings` is in addition to the `class`
  attribute passed with the angle bracket invocation syntax. Therefore, if this
  component was invoked like so:

  ```handlebars
  <MyWidget class="from-invocation" />
  ```

  The resulting HTML will look similar to this:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="from-invocation ember-view my-class my-other-class from-a from-b"></div>
  ```

  If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name
  itself will be used as the class name if the property is true. The class name
  will not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['hovered'];

    hovered = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view hovered"></div>
  ```

  ### Custom Class Names for Boolean Values

  When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other
  than the property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the
  preferred value after a ":" character when defining the binding:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['awesome:so-very-cool'];

    awesome = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view so-very-cool"></div>
  ```

  Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a
  camelCase-style format will be converted to a dasherized format:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['isUrgent'];

    isUrgent = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view is-urgent"></div>
  ```

  Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by
  traversing a path relative to the component itself:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';
  import EmberObject from '@ember/object';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['messages.empty'];

    messages = EmberObject.create({
      empty: true
    });
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view empty"></div>
  ```

  If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and and
  a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding like
  this:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled'];

    isEnabled = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view enabled"></div>
  ```

  When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML representation looks like this:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view disabled"></div>
  ```

  This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false
  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['isEnabled::disabled'];

    isEnabled = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component when the `isEnabled` property is true will produce
  HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view"></div>
  ```

  Invoking it when the `isEnabled` property on the component is `false` will
  produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view disabled"></div>
  ```

  Updates to the value of a class name binding will result in automatic update
  of the  HTML `class` attribute in the component's rendered HTML
  representation. If the value becomes `false` or `undefined` the class name
  will be removed.

  Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties. See
  [EmberObject](/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more
  information about concatenated properties.

  ### Other HTML Attributes

  The HTML attribute section of a component's tag can be set by providing an
  `attributeBindings` property set to an array of property names on the
  component. The return value of these properties will be used as the value of
  the component's HTML associated attribute:

  ```app/components/my-anchor.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'a';
    attributeBindings = ['href'];

    href = 'http://google.com';
  };
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <a id="ember1" class="ember-view" href="http://google.com"></a>
  ```

  One property can be mapped on to another by placing a ":" between the source
  property and the destination property:

  ```app/components/my-anchor.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'a';
    attributeBindings = ['url:href'];

    url = 'http://google.com';
  };
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <a id="ember1" class="ember-view" href="http://google.com"></a>
  ```

  HTML attributes passed with angle bracket invocations will take precedence
  over those specified in `attributeBindings`. Therefore, if this component was
  invoked like so:

  ```handlebars
  <MyAnchor href="http://bing.com" @url="http://google.com" />
  ```

  The resulting HTML will looks like this:

  ```html
  <a id="ember1" class="ember-view" href="http://bing.com"></a>
  ```

  Note that the `href` attribute is ultimately set to `http://bing.com`, despite
  it having attribute binidng to the `url` property, which was set to
  `http://google.com`.

  Namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`) are supported, but have to be
  mapped, since `:` is not a valid character for properties in Javascript:

  ```app/components/my-use.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'use';
    attributeBindings = ['xlinkHref:xlink:href'];

    xlinkHref = '#triangle';
  };
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <use xlink:href="#triangle"></use>
  ```

  If the value of a property monitored by `attributeBindings` is a boolean, the
  attribute will be present or absent depending on the value:

  ```app/components/my-text-input.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'input';
    attributeBindings = ['disabled'];

    disabled = false;
  };
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <input id="ember1" class="ember-view" />
  ```

  `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:

  ```app/components/my-text-input.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';
  import { computed } from '@ember/object';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'input';
    attributeBindings = ['disabled'];

    get disabled() {
      if (someLogic) {
        return true;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    }
  };
  ```

  To prevent setting an attribute altogether, use `null` or `undefined` as the
  value of the property used in `attributeBindings`:

  ```app/components/my-text-input.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'form';
    attributeBindings = ['novalidate'];
    novalidate = null;
  };
  ```

  Updates to the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic
  update of the  HTML attribute in the component's HTML output.

  `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See
  [EmberObject](/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more
  information about concatenated properties.

  ## Layouts

  The `layout` property can be used to dynamically specify a template associated
  with a component class, instead of relying on Ember to link together a
  component class and a template based on file names.

  In general, applications should not use this feature, but it's commonly used
  in addons for historical reasons.

  The `layout` property should be set to the default export of a template
  module, which is the name of a template file without the `.hbs` extension.

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>Person's Title</h1>
  <div class='details'>{{yield}}</div>
  ```

  ```app/components/person-profile.js
    import Component from '@ember/component';
    import layout from '../templates/components/person-profile';

    export default class extends Component {
      layout = layout;
    }
  ```

  If you invoke the component:

  ```handlebars
  <PersonProfile>
    <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>
    <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>
  </PersonProfile>
  ```

  or

  ```handlebars
  {{#person-profile}}
    <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>
    <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>
  {{/person-profile}}
  ```

  It will result in the following HTML output:

  ```html
  <h1>Person's Title</h1>
    <div class="details">
    <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>
    <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>
  </div>
  ```

  ## Handling Browser Events

  There are two ways to handle user-initiated events:

  ### Using the `on` modifier to capture browser events

  In a component's template, you can attach an event handler to any element with the `on` modifier:

  ```handlebars
  <button {{on 'click' this.doSomething}} />
  ```

  This will call the function on your component:

  ```js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class ExampleComponent extends Component {
    doSomething = (event) => {
      // `event` is the native click Event
      console.log('clicked on the button');
    };
  }
  ```

  See the [Guide on Component event
  handlers](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/component-state-and-actions/#toc_html-modifiers-and-actions)
  and the [API docs for `on`](../Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/on?anchor=on)
  for more details.

  ### Event Handler Methods

  Components can also respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method
  that matches the event name. This approach is appropriate when the same event
  should be handled by all instances of the same component.

  An event object will be passed as the argument to the event handler method.

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    click(event) {
      // `event.target` is either the component's element or one of its children
      let tag = event.target.tagName.toLowerCase();
      console.log('clicked on a `<${tag}>` HTML element!');
    }
  }
  ```

  In this example, whenever the user clicked anywhere inside the component, it
  will log a message to the console.

  It is possible to handle event types other than `click` by implementing the
  following event handler methods. In addition, custom events can be registered
  by using `Application.customEvents`.

  Touch events:

  * `touchStart`
  * `touchMove`
  * `touchEnd`
  * `touchCancel`

  Keyboard events:

  * `keyDown`
  * `keyUp`
  * `keyPress`

  Mouse events:

  * `mouseDown`
  * `mouseUp`
  * `contextMenu`
  * `click`
  * `doubleClick`
  * `focusIn`
  * `focusOut`

  Form events:

  * `submit`
  * `change`
  * `focusIn`
  * `focusOut`
  * `input`

  Drag and drop events:

  * `dragStart`
  * `drag`
  * `dragEnter`
  * `dragLeave`
  * `dragOver`
  * `dragEnd`
  * `drop`

     If the value of the property is a Boolean, the name of that property is
    added as a dasherized class name.
     ```javascript
    // Applies the 'is-urgent' class to the view element
    import Component from '@ember/component';
    Component.extend({
      classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],
      isUrgent: true
    });
    ```
     If you would prefer to use a custom value instead of the dasherized
    property name, you can pass a binding like this:
     ```javascript
    // Applies the 'urgent' class to the view element
    import Component from '@ember/component';
    Component.extend({
      classNameBindings: ['isUrgent:urgent'],
      isUrgent: true
    });
    ```
     If you would like to specify a class that should only be added when the
    property is false, you can declare a binding like this:
     ```javascript
    // Applies the 'disabled' class to the view element
    import Component from '@ember/component';
    Component.extend({
      classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled'],
      isEnabled: false
    });
    ```
     This list of properties is inherited from the component's superclasses as well.

  /**
    Normally, Ember's component model is "write-only". The component takes a
    bunch of attributes that it got passed in, and uses them to render its
    template.
     One nice thing about this model is that if you try to set a value to the
    same thing as last time, Ember (through HTMLBars) will avoid doing any
    work on the DOM.
     This is not just a performance optimization. If an attribute has not
    changed, it is important not to clobber the element's "hidden state".
    For example, if you set an input's `value` to the same value as before,
    it will clobber selection state and cursor position. In other words,
    setting an attribute is not **always** idempotent.
     This method provides a way to read an element's attribute and also
    update the last value Ember knows about at the same time. This makes
    setting an attribute idempotent.
     In particular, what this means is that if you get an `<input>` element's
    `value` attribute and then re-render the template with the same value,
    it will avoid clobbering the cursor and selection position.
    Since most attribute sets are idempotent in the browser, you typically
    can get away with reading attributes using jQuery, but the most reliable
    way to do so is through this method.
    @method readDOMAttr
     @param {String} name the name of the attribute
    @return String
    @public
    */
  readDOMAttr(name) {
    // TODO revisit this
    let _element = getViewElement(this);
    !(_element !== null) && assert$3(`Cannot call \`readDOMAttr\` on ${this} which does not have an element`, _element !== null);
    let element = _element;
    let isSVG = element.namespaceURI === 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg';
    let {
      type,
      normalized
    } = normalizeProperty(element, name);
    if (isSVG || type === 'attr') {
      return element.getAttribute(normalized);
    }
    return element[normalized];
  }

  // --- Declarations which support mixins ---
  // We use `declare` on these properties, even though they are optional, so
  // that they do not get created on the class *at all* when emitting the
  // transpiled code. Otherwise, since declared class properties are equivalent
  // to calling `defineProperty` in the class constructor, they would "stomp"
  // the properties supplied by mixins.

  /**
   A list of properties of the view to apply as attributes. If the property
   is a string value, the value of that string will be applied as the value
   for an attribute of the property's name.
    The following example creates a tag like `<div priority="high" />`.
    ```app/components/my-component.js
   import Component from '@ember/component';
    export default Component.extend({
      attributeBindings: ['priority'],
      priority: 'high'
    });
   ```
    If the value of the property is a Boolean, the attribute is treated as
   an HTML Boolean attribute. It will be present if the property is `true`
   and omitted if the property is `false`.
    The following example creates markup like `<div visible />`.
    ```app/components/my-component.js
   import Component from '@ember/component';
    export default Component.extend({
      attributeBindings: ['visible'],
      visible: true
    });
   ```
    If you would prefer to use a custom value instead of the property name,
   you can create the same markup as the last example with a binding like
   this:
    ```app/components/my-component.js
   import Component from '@ember/component';
    export default Component.extend({
      attributeBindings: ['isVisible:visible'],
      isVisible: true

  Ember Helpers are functions that can compute values, and are used in templates.
  For example, this code calls a helper named `format-currency`:

  ```app/templates/application.hbs
  <Cost @cents={{230}} />
  ```

  ```app/components/cost.hbs
  <div>{{format-currency @cents currency="$"}}</div>
  ```

  Additionally a helper can be called as a nested helper.
  In this example, we show the formatted currency value if the `showMoney`
  named argument is truthy.

  ```handlebars
  {{if @showMoney (format-currency @cents currency="$")}}
  ```

  Helpers defined using a class must provide a `compute` function. For example:

  ```app/helpers/format-currency.js
  import Helper from '@ember/component/helper';

  export default class extends Helper {
    compute([cents], { currency }) {
      return `${currency}${cents * 0.01}`;
    }
  }
  ```

  Each time the input to a helper changes, the `compute` function will be
  called again.

  As instances, these helpers also have access to the container and will accept
  injected dependencies.

  Additionally, class helpers can call `recompute` to force a new computation.

  be able to do `let myHelper = helper(someFn); new myHelper()`.

 *
 * @note This is *not* user-constructible: it is exported only so that the type

 */
// Making `FunctionBasedHelper` an alias this way allows callers to name it in
// terms meaningful to *them*, while preserving the type behavior described on
// the `abstract class FunctionBasedHelperInstance` below.

// This abstract class -- specifically, its `protected abstract __concrete__`
// member -- prevents subclasses from doing `class X extends helper(..)`, since
// that is an error at runtime. While it is rare that people would type that, it
// is not impossible and we use this to give them early signal via the types for
// a behavior which will break (and in a somewhat inscrutable way!) at runtime.
//
// This is needful because we lie about what this actually is for Glint's sake:
// a function-based helper returns a `Factory<SimpleHelper>`, which is designed
// to be "opaque" from a consumer's POV, i.e. not user-callable or constructible
// but only useable in a template (or via `invokeHelper()` which also treats it
// as a fully opaque `object` from a type POV). But Glint needs a `Helper<S>` to
// make it work the same way as class-based helpers. (Note that this does not
// hold for plain functions as helpers, which it can handle distinctly.) This
// signature thus makes it so that the item is usable *as* a `Helper` in Glint,
// but without letting end users treat it as a helper class instance.

/**
  In many cases it is not necessary to use the full `Helper` class.
  The `helper` method create pure-function helpers without instances.
  For example:

  ```app/helpers/format-currency.js
  import { helper } from '@ember/component/helper';

  export default helper(function([cents], {currency}) {
    return `${currency}${cents * 0.01}`;
  });

// the `helper` function and infer the resulting type correctly.

// This overload allows users to provide a `Signature` type explicitly at the
// helper definition site, e.g. `helper<Sig>((pos, named) => {...})`. **Note:**
// this overload must appear second, since TS' inference engine will not
// correctly infer the type of `S` here from the types on the supplied callback.

function helper$1(helperFn) {
  // SAFETY: this is completely lies, in two ways:
  //
  // 1. `Wrapper` is a `Factory<SimpleHelper<S>>`, but from the perspective of
  //    any external callers (i.e. Ember *users*), it is quite important that
  //    the `Factory` relationship be hidden, because it is not public API for
  //    an end user to call `.create()` on a helper created this way. Instead,
  //    we provide them an `abstract new` signature (which means it cannot be
  //    directly constructed by calling `new` on it) and which does not have the
  //    `.create()` signature on it anymore.
  //
  // 2. The produced type here ends up being a subtype of `Helper`, which is not
  //    strictly true. This is necessary for the sake of Glint, which provides
  //    its information by way of a "declaration merge" with `Helper<S>` in the
  //    case of items produced by `helper()`.
  //
  // Long-term, this entire construct can go away in favor of deprecating the
  // `helper()` invocation in favor of using plain functions.

  See the [routing guide](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/rendering-a-template/) for more

  The `ApplicationInstance` encapsulates all of the stateful aspects of a

  * Run time, where we begin executing the application once everything
    has loaded.

  Definition time can be expensive and only needs to happen once since it is
  an idempotent operation. For example, between test runs and FastBoot
  requests, the application stays the same. It is only the state that we want
  to reset.

  That state is what the `ApplicationInstance` manages: it is responsible for

  The `ContainerDebugAdapter` helps the container and resolver interface
  with tools that debug Ember such as the
  [Ember Inspector](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector)

  This class can be extended by a custom resolver implementer
  to override some of the methods with library-specific code.

  The methods likely to be overridden are:

  * `canCatalogEntriesByType`
  * `catalogEntriesByType`

  The adapter will need to be registered
  in the application's container as `container-debug-adapter:main`.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  Application.initializer({
    name: "containerDebugAdapter",

    initialize(application) {
      application.register('container-debug-adapter:main', require('app/container-debug-adapter'));

  /**
    The goal of initializers should be to register dependencies and injections.
    This phase runs once. Because these initializers may load code, they are
    allowed to defer application readiness and advance it. If you need to access
    the container or store you should use an InstanceInitializer that will be run
    after all initializers and therefore after all code is loaded and the app is
    ready.
     Initializer receives an object which has the following attributes:
    `name`, `before`, `after`, `initialize`. The only required attribute is
    `initialize`, all others are optional.
     * `name` allows you to specify under which name the initializer is registered.
    This must be a unique name, as trying to register two initializers with the
    same name will result in an error.
     ```app/initializer/named-initializer.js
    import { debug } from '@ember/debug';
     export function initialize() {
      debug('Running namedInitializer!');
    }
     export default {
      name: 'named-initializer',
      initialize
    };
    ```
     * `before` and `after` are used to ensure that this initializer is ran prior
    or after the one identified by the value. This value can be a single string
    or an array of strings, referencing the `name` of other initializers.
     An example of ordering initializers, we create an initializer named `first`:
     ```app/initializer/first.js
    import { debug } from '@ember/debug';
     export function initialize() {
      debug('First initializer!');
    }
     export default {
      name: 'first',
      initialize
    };
    ```
     ```bash
    // DEBUG: First initializer!
    ```
     We add another initializer named `second`, specifying that it should run
    after the initializer named `first`:
     ```app/initializer/second.js
    import { debug } from '@ember/debug';
     export function initialize() {
      debug('Second initializer!');
    }
     export default {
      name: 'second',
      after: 'first',
      initialize
    };
    ```
     ```
    // DEBUG: First initializer!
    // DEBUG: Second initializer!
    ```
     Afterwards we add a further initializer named `pre`, this time specifying
    that it should run before the initializer named `first`:
     ```app/initializer/pre.js
    import { debug } from '@ember/debug';
     export function initialize() {
      debug('Pre initializer!');
    }
     export default {
      name: 'pre',
      before: 'first',
      initialize
    };
    ```
     ```bash
    // DEBUG: Pre initializer!
    // DEBUG: First initializer!
    // DEBUG: Second initializer!
    ```
     Finally we add an initializer named `post`, specifying it should run after
    both the `first` and the `second` initializers:
     ```app/initializer/post.js
    import { debug } from '@ember/debug';
     export function initialize() {
      debug('Post initializer!');
    }
     export default {
      name: 'post',
      after: ['first', 'second'],
      initialize
    };
    ```
     ```bash
    // DEBUG: Pre initializer!
    // DEBUG: First initializer!
    // DEBUG: Second initializer!
    // DEBUG: Post initializer!
    ```
     * `initialize` is a callback function that receives one argument,
      `application`, on which you can operate.
     Example of using `application` to register an adapter:
     ```app/initializer/api-adapter.js
    import ApiAdapter from '../utils/api-adapter';
     export function initialize(application) {
      application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);
    }
     export default {
      name: 'post',
      after: ['first', 'second'],
      initialize
    };
    ```

     Instance initializer receives an object which has the following attributes:
    `name`, `before`, `after`, `initialize`. The only required attribute is
    `initialize`, all others are optional.
     * `name` allows you to specify under which name the instanceInitializer is

    and after.
     Example instanceInitializer to preload data into the store.
     ```app/initializer/preload-data.js
     export function initialize(application) {
        var userConfig, userConfigEncoded, store;
        // We have a HTML escaped JSON representation of the user's basic

/**
  An instance of `Application` is the starting point for every Ember
  application. It instantiates, initializes and coordinates the
  objects that make up your app.

  Each Ember app has one and only one `Application` object. Although
  Ember CLI creates this object implicitly, the `Application` class
  is defined in the `app/app.js`. You can define a `ready` method on the
  `Application` class, which will be run by Ember when the application is
  initialized.

  ```app/app.js
  export default class App extends Application {
    ready() {
      // your code here
    }
  }
  ```

  Because `Application` ultimately inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes
  you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.
  See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.

  While you can think of your `Application` as a container that holds the
  other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities
  going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand. It is also important
  to understand that an `Application` is different from an `ApplicationInstance`.
  Refer to the Guides to understand the difference between these.

  ### Event Delegation

  Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework
  to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to
  do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own
  `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`
  listener on the `body`.

  If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and
  start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking
  their `mouseDown` method as it goes.

  `Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as
  well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For
  example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be
  called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.

  If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by
  default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method
  names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:

  ```app/app.js
  import Application from '@ember/application';

  export default class App extends Application {
    customEvents = {
      // add support for the paste event
      paste: 'paste'
    }
  }
  ```

  To prevent Ember from setting up a listener for a default event,
  specify the event name with a `null` value in the `customEvents`
  property:

  ```app/app.js
  import Application from '@ember/application';

  export default class App extends Application {
    customEvents = {
      // prevent listeners for mouseenter/mouseleave events
      mouseenter: null,
      mouseleave: null
    }
  }
  ```

  By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document
  body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside
  an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element
  inside the body.

  For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`
  should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:

  ```app/app.js
  import Application from '@ember/application';

  export default class App extends Application {
    rootElement = '#ember-app'
  }
  ```

  The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a CSS selector
  string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will
  not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only
  append views inside it!

  To learn more about the events Ember components use, see

  [components/handling-events](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/handling-events/#toc_event-names).

  ### Initializers

  To add behavior to the Application's boot process, you can define initializers in
  the `app/initializers` directory, or with `ember generate initializer` using Ember CLI.
  These files should export a named `initialize` function which will receive the created `application`
  object as its first argument.

  ```javascript
  export function initialize(application) {
    // application.inject('route', 'foo', 'service:foo');
  }
  ```

  Application initializers can be used for a variety of reasons including:

  - setting up external libraries
  - injecting dependencies
  - setting up event listeners in embedded apps
  - deferring the boot process using the `deferReadiness` and `advanceReadiness` APIs.

  ### Routing

  In addition to creating your application's router, `Application` is
  also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions
  between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more
  detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with
  the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:

  ```javascript
  import Application from '@ember/application';

  let App = Application.create({
    LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions
    LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps
  });
  ```

  By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into
  application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you
  need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`
  method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.

  If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a
  `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing
  begins.

    instances.
     If you would like additional bubbling events to be delegated to your
    views, set your `Application`'s `customEvents` property
    to a hash containing the DOM event name as the key and the

     When `autoboot` is disabled, calling `visit` would first cause the
    application to boot, which runs the application initializers.
     This method also takes a hash of boot-time configuration options for
    customizing the instance's behavior. See the documentation on
    `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.
     `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` is an interface class that exists
    purely to document the available options; you do not need to construct it
    manually. Simply pass a regular JavaScript object containing of the
    desired options:
     ```javascript
    MyApp.visit("/", { location: "none", rootElement: "#container" });
    ```
     ### Supported Scenarios
     While the `BootOptions` class exposes a large number of knobs, not all
    combinations of them are valid; certain incompatible combinations might
    result in unexpected behavior.
     For example, booting the instance in the full browser environment
    while specifying a foreign `document` object (e.g. `{ isBrowser: true,
    document: iframe.contentDocument }`) does not work correctly today,
    largely due to Ember's jQuery dependency.
     Currently, there are three officially supported scenarios/configurations.
    Usages outside of these scenarios are not guaranteed to work, but please
    feel free to file bug reports documenting your experience and any issues
    you encountered to help expand support.
     #### Browser Applications (Manual Boot)
     The setup is largely similar to how Ember works out-of-the-box. Normally,
    Ember will boot a default instance for your Application on "DOM ready".
    However, you can customize this behavior by disabling `autoboot`.
     For example, this allows you to render a miniture demo of your application
    into a specific area on your marketing website:
     ```javascript
    import MyApp from 'my-app';
     $(function() {
      let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });
       let options = {
        // Override the router's location adapter to prevent it from updating
        // the URL in the address bar
        location: 'none',
         // Override the default `rootElement` on the app to render into a
        // specific `div` on the page
        rootElement: '#demo'
      };
       // Start the app at the special demo URL
      App.visit('/demo', options);
    });
    ```
     Or perhaps you might want to boot two instances of your app on the same
    page for a split-screen multiplayer experience:
     ```javascript
    import MyApp from 'my-app';
     $(function() {
      let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });
       let sessionId = MyApp.generateSessionID();
       let player1 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+1&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#left', location: 'none' });
      let player2 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+2&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#right', location: 'none' });
       Promise.all([player1, player2]).then(() => {
        // Both apps have completed the initial render
        $('#loading').fadeOut();
      });
    });
    ```
     Do note that each app instance maintains their own registry/container, so
    they will run in complete isolation by default.
     #### Server-Side Rendering (also known as FastBoot)
     This setup allows you to run your Ember app in a server environment using
    Node.js and render its content into static HTML for SEO purposes.
     ```javascript
    const HTMLSerializer = new SimpleDOM.HTMLSerializer(SimpleDOM.voidMap);
     function renderURL(url) {
      let dom = new SimpleDOM.Document();
      let rootElement = dom.body;
      let options = { isBrowser: false, document: dom, rootElement: rootElement };
       return MyApp.visit(options).then(instance => {
        try {
          return HTMLSerializer.serialize(rootElement.firstChild);
        } finally {
          instance.destroy();
        }
      });
    }
    ```
     In this scenario, because Ember does not have access to a global `document`
    object in the Node.js environment, you must provide one explicitly. In practice,
    in the non-browser environment, the stand-in `document` object only needs to
    implement a limited subset of the full DOM API. The `SimpleDOM` library is known
    to work.
     Since there is no DOM access in the non-browser environment, you must also
    specify a DOM `Element` object in the same `document` for the `rootElement` option
    (as opposed to a selector string like `"body"`).
     See the documentation on the `isBrowser`, `document` and `rootElement` properties
    on `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.
     #### Server-Side Resource Discovery
     This setup allows you to run the routing layer of your Ember app in a server
    environment using Node.js and completely disable rendering. This allows you
    to simulate and discover the resources (i.e. AJAX requests) needed to fulfill
    a given request and eagerly "push" these resources to the client.
     ```app/initializers/network-service.js
    import BrowserNetworkService from 'app/services/network/browser';
    import NodeNetworkService from 'app/services/network/node';
     // Inject a (hypothetical) service for abstracting all AJAX calls and use
    // the appropriate implementation on the client/server. This also allows the
    // server to log all the AJAX calls made during a particular request and use
    // that for resource-discovery purpose.
     export function initialize(application) {
      if (window) { // browser
        application.register('service:network', BrowserNetworkService);
      } else { // node
        application.register('service:network', NodeNetworkService);
      }
    };
     export default {
      name: 'network-service',
      initialize: initialize
    };
    ```
     ```app/routes/post.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
    import { service } from '@ember/service';
     // An example of how the (hypothetical) service is used in routes.
     export default class IndexRoute extends Route {
      @service network;
       model(params) {
        return this.network.fetch(`/api/posts/${params.post_id}.json`);
      }
       afterModel(post) {
        if (post.isExternalContent) {
          return this.network.fetch(`/api/external/?url=${post.externalURL}`);
        } else {
          return post;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
     ```javascript
    // Finally, put all the pieces together
     function discoverResourcesFor(url) {
      return MyApp.visit(url, { isBrowser: false, shouldRender: false }).then(instance => {
        let networkService = instance.lookup('service:network');
        return networkService.requests; // => { "/api/posts/123.json": "..." }
      });
    }

    when the associated parent object is destroyed.

  @module @ember/destroyable

/**

  Destruction via `destroy()` follows these steps:

  1, Mark the destroyable such that `isDestroying(destroyable)` returns `true`
  2, Call `destroy()` on each of the destroyable's associated children

  4, Schedule setting destroyable such that `isDestroyed(destroyable)` returns `true`

  This results in the entire tree of destroyables being first marked as destroying,
  then having all of their destructors called, and finally all being marked as isDestroyed.
  There won't be any in between states where some items are marked as `isDestroying` while
  destroying, while others are not.

  `capabilities` returns a capabilities configuration which can be used to modify
  the behavior of the manager. Manager capabilities _must_ be provided using the
  `capabilities` function, as the underlying implementation can change over time.

  The first argument to capabilities is a version string, which is the version of
  Ember that the capabilities were defined in. Ember can add new versions at any
  time, and these may have entirely different behaviors, but it will not remove
  old versions until the next major version.

  ```js
  capabilities('3.23');
  ```

  The second argument is an object of capabilities and boolean values indicating
  whether they are enabled or disabled.

  ```js
  capabilities('3.23', {
    hasValue: true,
    hasDestructor: true,
  });
  ```

  If no value is specified, then the default value will be used.

  ### `3.23` capabilities

  #### `hasDestroyable`

  - Default value: false

  Determines if the helper has a destroyable to include in the destructor
  hierarchy. If enabled, the `getDestroyable` hook will be called, and its result
  will be associated with the destroyable parent block.

  #### `hasValue`

  - Default value: false

  Determines if the helper has a value which can be used externally. The helper's
  `getValue` hook will be run whenever the value of the helper is accessed if this
  capability is enabled.

  @method capabilities
  @for @ember/helper
  @static
  @param {String} managerApiVersion The version of capabilities that are being used

const capabilities = helperCapabilities;

/**
  Sets the helper manager for an object or function.

  ```js
  setHelperManager((owner) => new ClassHelperManager(owner), Helper)
  ```

  When a value is used as a helper in a template, the helper manager is looked up
  on the object by walking up its prototype chain and finding the first helper
  manager. This manager then receives the value and can create and manage an
  instance of a helper from it. This provides a layer of indirection that allows
  users to design high-level helper APIs, without Ember needing to worry about the
  details. High-level APIs can be experimented with and iterated on while the
  core of Ember helpers remains stable, and new APIs can be introduced gradually
  over time to existing code bases.

  `setHelperManager` receives two arguments:

  1. A factory function, which receives the `owner` and returns an instance of a
    helper manager.
  2. A helper definition, which is the object or function to associate the factory function with.

  The first time the object is looked up, the factory function will be called to
  create the helper manager. It will be cached, and in subsequent lookups the
  cached helper manager will be used instead.

  Only one helper manager is guaranteed to exist per `owner` and per usage of
  `setHelperManager`, so many helpers will end up using the same instance of the
  helper manager. As such, you should only store state that is related to the
  manager itself. If you want to store state specific to a particular helper
  definition, you should assign a unique helper manager to that helper. In
  general, most managers should either be stateless, or only have the `owner` they
  were created with as state.

  Helper managers must fulfill the following interface (This example uses
  [TypeScript interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html)
  for precision, you do not need to write helper managers using TypeScript):

  ```ts
  interface HelperManager<HelperStateBucket> {
    capabilities: HelperCapabilities;

    createHelper(definition: HelperDefinition, args: TemplateArgs): HelperStateBucket;

    getValue?(bucket: HelperStateBucket): unknown;

    runEffect?(bucket: HelperStateBucket): void;

    getDestroyable?(bucket: HelperStateBucket): object;
  }
  ```

  The capabilities property _must_ be provided using the `capabilities()` function
  imported from the same module as `setHelperManager`:

  ```js
  import { capabilities } from '@ember/helper';

  class MyHelperManager {
    capabilities = capabilities('3.21.0', { hasValue: true });

    // ...snip...
  }
  ```

  Below is a description of each of the methods on the interface and their
  functions.

  #### `createHelper`

  `createHelper` is a required hook on the HelperManager interface. The hook is
  passed the definition of the helper that is currently being created, and is
  expected to return a _state bucket_. This state bucket is what represents the
  current state of the helper, and will be passed to the other lifecycle hooks at
  appropriate times. It is not necessarily related to the definition of the
  helper itself - for instance, you could return an object _containing_ an
  instance of the helper:

  ```js
  class MyManager {
    createHelper(Definition, args) {
      return {
        instance: new Definition(args);
      };
    }
  }
  ```

  This allows the manager to store metadata that it doesn't want to expose to the
  user.

  This hook is _not_ autotracked - changes to tracked values used within this hook
  will _not_ result in a call to any of the other lifecycle hooks. This is because
  it is unclear what should happen if it invalidates, and rather than make a
  decision at this point, the initial API is aiming to allow as much expressivity
  as possible. This could change in the future with changes to capabilities and
  their behaviors.

  If users do want to autotrack some values used during construction, they can
  either create the instance of the helper in `runEffect` or `getValue`, or they
  can use the `cache` API to autotrack the `createHelper` hook themselves. This
  provides maximum flexibility and expressiveness to manager authors.

  This hook has the following timing semantics:

  **Always**
  - called as discovered during DOM construction
  - called in definition order in the template

  #### `getValue`

  `getValue` is an optional hook that should return the value of the helper. This
  is the value that is returned from the helper and passed into the template.

  This hook is called when the value is requested from the helper (e.g. when the
  template is rendering and the helper value is needed). The hook is autotracked,
  and will rerun whenever any tracked values used inside of it are updated.
  Otherwise it does not rerun.

  > Note: This means that arguments which are not _consumed_ within the hook will
  > not trigger updates.

  This hook is only called for helpers with the `hasValue` capability enabled.
  This hook has the following timing semantics:

  **Always**
  - called the first time the helper value is requested
  - called after autotracked state has changed

  **Never**
  - called if the `hasValue` capability is disabled

  #### `runEffect`

  `runEffect` is an optional hook that should run the effect that the helper is
  applying, setting it up or updating it.

  This hook is scheduled to be called some time after render and prior to paint.
  There is not a guaranteed, 1-to-1 relationship between a render pass and this
  hook firing. For instance, multiple render passes could occur, and the hook may
  only trigger once. It may also never trigger if it was dirtied in one render
  pass and then destroyed in the next.

  The hook is autotracked, and will rerun whenever any tracked values used inside
  of it are updated. Otherwise it does not rerun.

  The hook is also run during a time period where state mutations are _disabled_
  in Ember. Any tracked state mutation will throw an error during this time,
  including changes to tracked properties, changes made using `Ember.set`, updates
  to computed properties, etc. This is meant to prevent infinite rerenders and
  other antipatterns.

  This hook is only called for helpers with the `hasScheduledEffect` capability
  enabled. This hook is also not called in SSR currently, though this could be
  added as a capability in the future. It has the following timing semantics:

  **Always**
  - called after the helper was first created, if the helper has not been
    destroyed since creation
  - called after autotracked state has changed, if the helper has not been
    destroyed during render

  **Never**
  - called if the `hasScheduledEffect` capability is disabled
  - called in SSR

  #### `getDestroyable`

  `getDestroyable` is an optional hook that users can use to register a
  destroyable object for the helper. This destroyable will be registered to the
  containing block or template parent, and will be destroyed when it is destroyed.
  See the [Destroyables RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0580-destroyables.md)
  for more details.

  `getDestroyable` is only called if the `hasDestroyable` capability is enabled.

  This hook has the following timing semantics:

  **Always**
  - called immediately after the `createHelper` hook is called

  **Never**
  - called if the `hasDestroyable` capability is disabled

/**
  The `invokeHelper` function can be used to create a helper instance in
  JavaScript.

  To access a helper's value you have to use `getValue` from
  `@glimmer/tracking/primitives/cache`.

  ```js
  // app/components/data-loader.js
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';
  import { getValue } from '@glimmer/tracking/primitives/cache';
  import Helper from '@ember/component/helper';
  import { invokeHelper } from '@ember/helper';

  class PlusOne extends Helper {
    compute([number]) {
      return number + 1;
    }
  }

  export default class PlusOneComponent extends Component {
    plusOne = invokeHelper(this, PlusOne, () => {
      return {
        positional: [this.args.number],
      };
    });

    get value() {
      return getValue(this.plusOne);
    }
  }
  ```
  ```js
  {{this.value}}
  ```

  It receives three arguments:

  * `context`: The parent context of the helper. When the parent is torn down and
    removed, the helper will be as well.
  * `definition`: The definition of the helper.
  * `computeArgs`: An optional function that produces the arguments to the helper.
    The function receives the parent context as an argument, and must return an
    object with a `positional` property that is an array and/or a `named`
    property that is an object.

  And it returns a Cache instance that contains the most recent value of the
  helper. You can access the helper using `getValue()` like any other cache. The
  cache is also destroyable, and using the `destroy()` function on it will cause
  the helper to be torn down.

  Note that using `getValue()` on helpers that have scheduled effects will not
  trigger the effect early. Effects will continue to run at their scheduled time.

/**
 * The `Component` class defines an encapsulated UI element that is rendered to
 * the DOM. A component is made up of a template and, optionally, this component
 * object.
 *
 * ## Defining a Component
 *
 * To define a component, subclass `Component` and add your own properties,
 * methods and lifecycle hooks:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import Component from '@glimmer/component';
 *
 * export default class extends Component {
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Lifecycle Hooks
 *
 * Lifecycle hooks allow you to respond to changes to a component, such as when
 * it gets created, rendered, updated or destroyed. To add a lifecycle hook to a
 * component, implement the hook as a method on your component subclass.
 *
 * For example, to be notified when Glimmer has rendered your component so you
 * can attach a legacy jQuery plugin, implement the `didInsertElement()` method:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import Component from '@glimmer/component';
 *
 * export default class extends Component {
 *   didInsertElement() {
 *     $(this.element).pickadate();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Data for Templates
 *
 * `Component`s have two different kinds of data, or state, that can be
 * displayed in templates:
 *
 * 1. Arguments
 * 2. Properties
 *
 * Arguments are data that is passed in to a component from its parent
 * component. For example, if I have a `UserGreeting` component, I can pass it
 * a name and greeting to use:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * <UserGreeting @name="Ricardo" @greeting="Olá" />
 * ```
 *
 * Inside my `UserGreeting` template, I can access the `@name` and `@greeting`
 * arguments that I've been given:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * {{@greeting}}, {{@name}}!
 * ```
 *
 * Arguments are also available inside my component:
 *
 * ```ts
 * console.log(this.args.greeting); // prints "Olá"
 * ```
 *
 * Properties, on the other hand, are internal to the component and declared in
 * the class. You can use properties to store data that you want to show in the
 * template, or pass to another component as an argument.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import Component from '@glimmer/component';
 *
 * export default class extends Component {
 *   user = {
 *     name: 'Robbie'
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In the above example, we've defined a component with a `user` property that
 * contains an object with its own `name` property.
 *
 * We can render that property in our template:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * Hello, {{user.name}}!
 * ```
 *
 * We can also take that property and pass it as an argument to the
 * `UserGreeting` component we defined above:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * <UserGreeting @greeting="Hello" @name={{user.name}} />
 * ```
 *
 * ## Arguments vs. Properties
 *
 * Remember, arguments are data that was given to your component by its parent
 * component, and properties are data your component has defined for itself.
 *
 * You can tell the difference between arguments and properties in templates
 * because arguments always start with an `@` sign (think "A is for arguments"):
 *
 * ```hbs
 * {{@firstName}}
 * ```
 *
 * We know that `@firstName` came from the parent component, not the current
 * component, because it starts with `@` and is therefore an argument.
 *
 * On the other hand, if we see:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * {{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * We know that `name` is a property on the component. If we want to know where
 * the data is coming from, we can go look at our component class to find out.
 *
 * Inside the component itself, arguments always show up inside the component's
 * `args` property. For example, if `{{@firstName}}` is `Tom` in the template,
 * inside the component `this.args.firstName` would also be `Tom`.

/**
  A component is a reusable UI element that consists of a `.hbs` template and an
  optional JavaScript class that defines its behavior. For example, someone
  might make a `button` in the template and handle the click behavior in the
  JavaScript file that shares the same name as the template.

  Components are broken down into two categories:

  - Components _without_ JavaScript, that are based only on a template. These
    are called Template-only or TO components.
  - Components _with_ JavaScript, which consist of a template and a backing
    class.

  Ember ships with two types of JavaScript classes for components:

  1. Glimmer components, imported from `@glimmer/component`, which are the
     default components for Ember Octane (3.15) and more recent editions.
  2. Classic components, imported from `@ember/component`, which were the
     default for older editions of Ember (pre 3.15).

  Below is the documentation for Template-only and Glimmer components. If you
  are looking for the API documentation for Classic components, it is
  [available here](/ember/release/classes/Component). The source code for
  Glimmer components can be found in [`@glimmer/component`](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer.js/tree/master/packages/%40glimmer/component).

  ## Defining a Template-only Component

  The simplest way to create a component is to create a template file in
  `app/templates/components`. For example, if you name a template
  `app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs`:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{@person.name}}</h1>
  <img src={{@person.avatar}}>
  <p class='signature'>{{@person.signature}}</p>
  ```

  You will be able to use `<PersonProfile />` to invoke this component elsewhere
  in your application:

  ```app/templates/application.hbs
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} />
  ```

  Note that component names are capitalized here in order to distinguish them
  from regular HTML elements, but they are dasherized in the file system.

  While the angle bracket invocation form is generally preferred, it is also
  possible to invoke the same component with the `{{person-profile}}` syntax:

  ```app/templates/application.hbs
  {{person-profile person=this.currentUser}}
  ```

  Note that with this syntax, you use dashes in the component name and
  arguments are passed without the `@` sign.

  In both cases, Ember will render the content of the component template we
  created above. The end result will be something like this:

  ```html
  <h1>Tomster</h1>
  <img src="https://emberjs.com/tomster.jpg">
  <p class='signature'>Out of office this week</p>
  ```

  ## File System Nesting

  Components can be nested inside sub-folders for logical groupping. For
  example, if we placed our template in
  `app/templates/components/person/short-profile.hbs`, we can invoke it as
  `<Person::ShortProfile />`:

  ```app/templates/application.hbs
  <Person::ShortProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} />
  ```

  Or equivalently, `{{person/short-profile}}`:

  ```app/templates/application.hbs
  {{person/short-profile person=this.currentUser}}
  ```

  ## Using Blocks

  You can use `yield` inside a template to include the **contents** of any block
  attached to the component. For instance, if we added a `{{yield}}` to our
  component like so:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{@person.name}}</h1>
  {{yield}}
  ```

  We could then invoke it like this:

  ```handlebars
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>
    <p>Admin mode</p>
  </PersonProfile>
  ```

  or with curly syntax like this:

  ```handlebars
  {{#person-profile person=this.currentUser}}
    <p>Admin mode</p>
  {{/person-profile}}
  ```

  And the content passed in between the brackets of the component would be
  rendered in the same place as the `{{yield}}` within it, replacing it.

  Blocks are executed in their original context, meaning they have access to the
  scope and any in-scope variables where they were defined.

  ### Passing parameters to blocks

  You can also pass positional parameters to `{{yield}}`, which are then made
  available in the block:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{@person.name}}</h1>
  {{yield @person.signature}}
  ```

  We can then use this value in the block like so:

  ```handlebars
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} as |signature|>
    {{signature}}
  </PersonProfile>
  ```

  ### Passing multiple blocks

  You can pass multiple blocks to a component by giving them names, and
  specifying which block you are yielding to with `{{yield}}`. For instance, if
  we wanted to add a way for users to customize the title of our
  `<PersonProfile>` component, we could add a named block inside of the header:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{yield to="title"}}</h1>
  {{yield}}
  ```

  This component could then be invoked like so:

  ```handlebars
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>
    <:title>{{this.currentUser.name}}</:title>
    <:default>{{this.currentUser.signature}}</:default>
  </PersonProfile>
  ```

  When passing named blocks, you must name every block, including the `default`
  block, which is the block that is defined if you do not pass a `to` parameter
  to `{{yield}}`. Whenever you invoke a component without passing explicitly
  named blocks, the passed block is considered the `default` block.

  ### Passing parameters to named blocks

  You can also pass parameters to named blocks:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{yield @person.name to="title"}}</h1>
  {{yield @person.signature}}
  ```

  These parameters can then be used like so:

  ```handlebars
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>
    <:title as |name|>{{name}}</:title>
    <:default as |signature|>{{signature}}</:default>
  </PersonProfile>
  ```

  ### Checking to see if a block exists

  You can also check to see if a block exists using the `(has-block)` keyword,
  and conditionally use it, or provide a default template instead.

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>
    {{#if (has-block "title")}}
      {{yield @person.name to="title"}}
    {{else}}
      {{@person.name}}
    {{/if}}
  </h1>

  {{#if (has-block)}}
    {{yield @person.signature}}
  {{else}}
    {{@person.signature}}
  {{/if}}
  ```

  With this template, we can then optionally pass in one block, both blocks, or
  none at all:

  ```handlebars
  {{! passing both blocks }}
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>
    <:title as |name|>{{name}}</:title>
    <:default as |signature|>{{signature}}</:default>
  </PersonProfile>

  {{! passing just the title block }}
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>
    <:title as |name|>{{name}}</:title>
  </PersonProfile>

  {{! passing just the default block }}
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} as |signature|>
    {{signature}}
  </PersonProfile>

  {{! not passing any blocks }}
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}/>
  ```

  ### Checking to see if a block has parameters

  We can also check if a block receives parameters using the `(has-block-params)`
  keyword, and conditionally yield different values if so.

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  {{#if (has-block-params)}}
    {{yield @person.signature}}
  {{else}}
    {{yield}}
  {{/if}}
  ```

  ## Customizing Components With JavaScript

  To add JavaScript to a component, create a JavaScript file in the same
  location as the template file, with the same name, and export a subclass
  of `Component` as the default value. For example, to add Javascript to the
  `PersonProfile` component which we defined above, we would create
  `app/components/person-profile.js` and export our class as the default, like
  so:

  ```app/components/person-profile.js
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';

  export default class PersonProfileComponent extends Component {
    get displayName() {
      let { title, firstName, lastName } = this.args.person;

      if (title) {
        return `${title} ${lastName}`;
      } else {
        return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
      }
    })
  }
  ```

  You can add your own properties, methods, and lifecycle hooks to this
  subclass to customize its behavior, and you can reference the instance of the
  class in your template using `{{this}}`. For instance, we could access the
  `displayName` property of our `PersonProfile` component instance in the
  template like this:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{this.displayName}}</h1>
  {{yield}}
  ```

  ## `constructor`

  params: `owner` object and `args` object

  Constructs a new component and assigns itself the passed properties. The
  constructor is run whenever a new instance of the component is created, and
  can be used to setup the initial state of the component.

  ```javascript
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';

  export default class SomeComponent extends Component {
    constructor(owner, args) {
      super(owner, args);

      if (this.args.displayMode === 'list') {
        this.items = [];
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Service injections and arguments are available in the constructor.

  ```javascript
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';
  import { service } from '@ember/service';

  export default class SomeComponent extends Component {
    @service myAnimations;

    constructor(owner, args) {
      super(owner, args);

      if (this.args.fadeIn === true) {
        this.myAnimations.register(this, 'fade-in');
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ## `willDestroy`

  `willDestroy` is called after the component has been removed from the DOM, but
  before the component is fully destroyed. This lifecycle hook can be used to
  cleanup the component and any related state.

  ```javascript
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';
  import { service } from '@ember/service';

  export default class SomeComponent extends Component {
    @service myAnimations;

    willDestroy() {
      super.willDestroy(...arguments);

      this.myAnimations.unregister(this);
    }
  }
  ```

  ## `args`

  The `args` property of Glimmer components is an object that contains the
  _arguments_ that are passed to the component. For instance, the
  following component usage:

  ```handlebars
  <SomeComponent @fadeIn={{true}} />
  ```

  Would result in the following `args` object to be passed to the component:

  ```javascript
  { fadeIn: true }
  ```

  `args` can be accessed at any point in the component lifecycle, including
  `constructor` and `willDestroy`. They are also automatically marked as tracked
  properties, and they can be depended on as computed property dependencies:

  ```javascript
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';
  import { computed } from '@ember/object';

  export default class SomeComponent extends Component {

    @computed('args.someValue')
    get computedGetter() {
      // updates whenever args.someValue updates
      return this.args.someValue;
    }

    get standardGetter() {
      // updates whenever args.anotherValue updates (Ember 3.13+)
      return this.args.anotherValue;
    }
  }
  ```

  ## `isDestroying`

  A boolean flag to tell if the component is in the process of destroying. This is set to
  true before `willDestroy` is called.

  ## `isDestroyed`
  A boolean to tell if the component has been fully destroyed. This is set to true
  after `willDestroy` is called.

/**
 * Returns a reactive state for a given value, function, promise, or function that returns a promise.
 *
 * Also caches the result for the given value, so `getPromiseState` will become synchronous if the passed value
 * has already been resolved.
 *
 * Normally when trying to derive async state, you'll first need to invoke a function to get the promise from that function's return value.
 * With `getPromiseState`, a passed function will be invoked for you, so you can skip that step.
 *
 * @example
 * We can use `getPromiseState` to dynamically load and render a component
 *
 * ```gjs
 * let state = getPromiseState(() => import('./some-module/component'));
 *
 * <template>
 *   {{#if state.isLoading}}
 *     ... pending ...
 *   {{else if state.error}}
 *     oh no!
 *   {{else if state.resolved}}
 *     <state.resolved />
 *   {{/if}}
 * </template>
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * `getPromiseState` can also be used in a class without `@cached`, because it maintains its own cache.
 * ```gjs
 * import Component from '@glimmer/component';
 *
 * async function readFromSomewhere() { // implementation omitted for brevity
 * }
 *
 * export default class Demo extends Component {
 *   // doesn't matter how many times state is accessed, you get a stable state
 *   get state() {
 *     return getPromiseState(readFromSomewhere);
 *   }
 *
 *   <template>
 *     {{#if this.state.resolved}}
 *        ...
 *     {{/if}}
 *   </template>
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * A reactively constructed function will also be used and have its result cached between uses
 *
 * ```gjs
 * import Component from '@glimmer/component';
 *
 * async function readFromSomewhere() { // implementation omitted for brevity
 * }
 *
 * export default class Demo extends Component {
 *   // Note: the @cached is important here because we don't want repeat accesses
 *   //       to cause doAsync to be called again unless @id changes
 *   @cached
 *   get promise() {
 *     return this.doAsync(this.args.id);
 *   }
 *
 *   get state() {
 *     return getPromiseState(this.promise);
 *   }
 *
 *   <template>
 *     {{#if this.state.resolved}}
 *        ...
 *     {{/if}}
 *   </template>
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * NOTE: This `getPromiseState` is not a replacement for [WarpDrive](https://docs.warp-drive.io/)'s [getRequestState](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@warp-drive/ember#getrequeststate)
 *       namely, the `getPromiseState` in this library (reactiveweb) does not support futures, cancellation, or anything else specific to warp-drive.

/**
 * Contains interfaces which describe the JSON output. Each interface is related to a specific type of serializer.

 * ## Plugins
 * Plugins which modify the serialization process can use declaration merging
 * to add custom properties to the exported interfaces.

 * ```ts
 * declare module 'typedoc/dist/lib/serialization/schema' {
 *     export interface AbstractReflection {
 *         myCustomProp: boolean

 *
 * If a plugin defines a new Model type, {@link ModelToObject} will not pick up the serializer type and
 * the resulting type will not be included in the return type of {@link Serializer.toObject}.
 * To fix this, use declaration merging to augment the {@link Serializer} class.
 * ```ts
 * declare module 'typedoc/dist/lib/serialization/serializer' {
 *     export interface Serializer {
 *         toObject(value: CustomModel, obj?: Partial<CustomModel>): CustomOutput

/**
 * A utility decorator for smoothing out changes in upstream data between
 * refreshes / reload.
 *
 * @example
 * when using RemoteData (or some other promise-based "eventually a value" resource),
 * the value returned from the API is what's useful to see to users. But if the URL
 * changes, the remote request will start anew, and isLoading becomes true, and the value is falsey until the request finishes. This can result in some flicker
 * until the new request finishes.
 *
 * To smooth that out, we can use [[keepLatest]]
 *
 * ```js
 *  import { RemoteData } from 'reactiveweb/remote-data';
 *  import { keepLatest } from 'reactiveweb/keep-latest';
 *  import { use } from 'ember-resources';
 *
 *  class A {
 *    @use request = RemoteData(() => 'some url');
 *    @use data = keepLatest({
 *      value: () => this.request.value,
 *      when: () => this.request.isLoading,
 *    });
 *
 *    get result() {
 *      // after the initial request, this is always resolved
 *      return this.data;
 *    }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * To specify a default value, use an additional getter
 * ```js
 *  import { RemoteData } from 'reactiveweb/remote-data';
 *  import { keepLatest } from 'reactiveweb/keep-latest';
 *  import { use } from 'ember-resources';
 *
 *  class A {
 *    @use request = RemoteData(() => 'some url');
 *    @use data = keepLatest({
 *      value: () => this.request.value,
 *      when: () => this.request.isLoading,
 *    });
 *
 *    get latest() {
 *      // after the initial request, this is always resolved
 *      return this.data;
 *    }
 *
 *    get result() {
 *      return this.latest ?? { default: 'value' };
 *    }

 *  1) The resolver makes the container aware of es6 modules via the AMD
 *     output. The loader's _moduleEntries is consulted so that classes can be
 *     resolved directly via the module loader, without needing a manual
 *     `import`.
 *  2) is able to provide injections to classes that implement `extend`
 *     (as is typical with Ember).

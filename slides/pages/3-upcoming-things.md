<!-- 

Alight -- 

so what's coming up next for ember?

*I* want to enable more experimentation.

Not just for me, because I think it's fun, but for everyone.

[click] So that everyone can can experiment and use ember in more than just web apps. 

So.. I have a plan

3 years ago, I said I would write the resources RFC

I've also opened a Cell RFC, but in doing both of these,
more questions have been raised.

Both of these were in relation to Starbeam, and trying to align Starbeam's efforts with how Ember
works today.

To say my dream for Ember gotten a little ambitious is perhaps an understatement, but I
think it is still achievable -- maybe not myself doing each of these bottom integrations here, but
working with the community to adapt ember's architecture to work with everything..

We want to be able to explore swapping out our current renderer, the GlimmerVM.

I want to continue the exploration that Starbeam started,  

as well as the research in Glimmer Next so that we can not only boost our base rendering speed and compete on performance with our peer frameworks, 

as well as also become a universal framework. 

In particular, for my own side projects, I make a lot of dinky CLI apps, and would like to use ember
in a CLI environment -- beyond the demo I showed just a little bit ago -- but serious CLI apps. I
also have had a bit of a itch to explore 3D or gaming environments, as web interfaces are, to be
reductive, just rectangles.

With TC39's Signals, and Starbeam's research, and with how long it takes all the frameworks to coalesce 

(and with how everyone currently has different reactivity (even if everyone calls things signals, they behave different from each
other and are different APIs entirely)), 

Ember can become the universal glue and orchestrator in all the chaos that is the
broader JS ecosystem.

RFCs and community collaboration pending, of course.

and now that Vite is shipped, a lot more opportunities are open to us

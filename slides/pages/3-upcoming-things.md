3 years ago, I said I would write the resources RFC

I've also opened a Cell RFC, but in doing both of these,
more questions have been raised.

Ultimately, we want to be able to explore swapping out our current renderer, the GlimmerVM.
Starbeam was announced as an experiment a couple years ago, and I plan to continue the exploration
in to how we can continue that research, as well as the research in Glimmer Next so that we can
not only boost our base rendering speed and compete on performance with our peer frameworks, but
also become a universal framework ourselves. With TC39's Signals, and Starbeam's research, and
with how long it takes all the frameworks to coalesce (and with how everyone currently has
different reactivity (even if everyone calls things signals, they behave different from each
other)), Ember can become the universale glue and orchestrator in all the chaos that is the
broader JS ecosystem.

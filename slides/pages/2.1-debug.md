# ✨ Debugging ✨

<!-- 

We all have to debug for our jobs, but there are same debug tools that I've noticed are not very
commonly used in web dev, so I wanted to quick share what those are, and how to configure them.

<div v-click style="transform: rotate(20deg) translateX(40vw) translateY(25vh); font-size: 2rem">
	logging
</div>
<div v-click style="transform: rotate(-15deg) translateX(40vw) translateY(25vh); font-size: 2rem">
	breakpoints
</div>
<div v-click style="transform: rotate(35deg) translateX(60vw) translateY(-5vh); font-size: 2rem">
	REPL
</div>


<!-- 

So, in all of debugging, we have three techniques, which have various ways of using and interacting
with your code.

[click] logging
[click] breakpoints
[click] and REPLs

However, how you got about using these 3 techniques can greatly change how effective you are at
figuriing out what is going on

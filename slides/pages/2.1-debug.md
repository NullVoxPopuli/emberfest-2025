# âœ¨ Debugging âœ¨

<!-- 

We all have to debug for our jobs, but there are same debug tools that I've noticed are not very
commonly used in web dev, so I wanted to quick share what those are, and how to configure them.

# âœ¨ Debugging âœ¨


<h2 style="transform: rotate(-30deg); font-size: 3rem;">
The tools available
</h2>

<div v-click style="transform: rotate(20deg) translateX(40vw) translateY(25vh); font-size: 2rem">
	logging
</div>
<div v-click style="transform: rotate(-15deg) translateX(40vw) translateY(25vh); font-size: 2rem">
	breakpoints

<div v-click style="transform: rotate(35deg) translateX(60vw) translateY(-5vh); font-size: 2rem">
	REPL

<!-- 

So, in all of debugging, we have three techniques, which have various ways of using and interacting
with your code.

[click] logging
[click] breakpoints
[click] and REPLs

However, how you got about using these 3 techniques can greatly change how effective you are at
figuriing out what is going on

# âœ¨ Debugging âœ¨ via logging

<div class="centered">

## `console.log`

<div v-click style="font-size: 15rem; position: absolute;">
	ðŸš«
</div>

</div>

<!--

console.log.

[click] we don't want to do this.
a few reasons:
- requires a code change in order to see things
- if your code uses a build, this will require a rebuild of the changed code
- if your code is in the browser, and you don't have hot-module-reloading, 
  you have to wait for a full browser refresh, and all those network requests, etc

## logpoints



<div class="image-stack">

<img v-after src="/images/debugging-menu.png" />
<Arrow v-click.after.hide="1" x1="75" y1="155" x2="100" y2="140" color="red" />
<img style="position: absolute; left: 3rem; top: 7rem;" v-click src="/images/logpoint-begin.png" />
<img style="position: absolute; left: 3.5rem; top: 7.5rem;" v-click src="/images/logpoint-filled.png" />
<img style="position: absolute; left: 4rem; top: 8rem;" v-click src="/images/logpoint-marked.png" />
<img style="position: absolute; left: 4.5rem; top: 8.5rem;" v-click src="/images/logpoint-result.png" />

</div>	

<!-- 

we start with right-clicking the gutter on the left side of a file in the sources or debugger panel
of the browser's tools

[click] we're presented with a little inline modal here where we can enter what we want to log, and
say if we want the stack printed as well.

[click] I like having the stack trace, but I understand it can often be redundant and noisy for how
some folks like to debug

[click] this is what the created logpoint looks like -- a Pink lil'flag thing

[click] and here is what it looks like -- the console has a similar color indicator to the left, it
logs what we told it to. On the right, it tells us where the logpoint is, and then we have a stack
for how we got to `compiler.ts` line 49


I find this technique is most useful for when I have to figure out how a particular function is
getting called _and_ I expect it to be called multiple times, and I don't want to pause at every
call in to a function. and I didn't need to change any of the source code to gain this information. 

... but speaking of pausing at a call in to a function.

# âœ¨ Debugging âœ¨ via breakpoints


<div class="centered">

## `debugger`

<div v-click style="font-size: 15rem; position: absolute;">
	ðŸš«
</div>

</div>

<!-- 

Next up is the debugger.

[click] we don't want to do this either, and for similar reasons:
- requires a code change in order to see things
- if your code uses a build, this will require a rebuild of the changed code
- if your code is in the browser, and you don't have hot-module-reloading, 
  you have to wait for a full browser refresh, and all those network requests, etc

## Breakpoints

<div class="image-stack">

<img v-after src="/images/debugging-menu.png" />
<Arrow v-click.after.hide="1" x1="75" y1="155" x2="100" y2="140" color="red" />
<img style="position: absolute; left: 3rem; top: 7rem;" v-click src="/images/breakpoint-condition-begin.png" />
<img style="position: absolute; left: 3rem; top: 7rem;" v-click src="/images/breakpoint-condition-filled.png" />
<img style="position: absolute; left: 3rem; top: 7rem;" v-click src="/images/breakpoint-condition-marked.png" />
<img style="position: absolute; left: 3rem; top: 7rem;" v-click src="/images/breakpoint-condition-result.png" />

</div>

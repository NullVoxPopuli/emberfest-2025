# Action items

- for you
  - go experiment
  - dive deep in to `node_modules`

- for me
  - spike out new renderer (learn how these _really_ work)
  - spike out flexible (low-level) core reactivity integration
  - RFC: try/catch
  - RFC: "Starbeam"

<!-- 

So here are some action items for both you and for me.

It took me 3 years to put up the Resources RFC, and like.. it wasn't bad, it just mostly me
struggling with my own activation energy.

But, hopefully before 3 years shows up again, I can make better progress (with help from all of your
of course)

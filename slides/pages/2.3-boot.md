# ✨ Booting ✨ 

<!-- 

Alright now let's talk about booting ember apps.

# How to boot an application

<div class="large-code full-width">

````md magic-move { at: 2}

```js  {3}{lines:true}
// in index.html
import Application from './app/app';
import environment from './app/config/environment';

Application.create(environment.APP);
```

```js {*}{lines:true }
// in index.html
import Application from './app/app';

Application.create({});
```

```js {*}{lines:true }
// in index.html
import Application from '@ember/application';

class App extends Application {}

App.create({});
```

```js {*}{lines:true }
// in index.html
import Application from '@ember/application';
import Foo from './wherever';

class App extends Application {
	modules = {
		'./services/foo.js': Foo,
	}
}

App.create({});
```

````

</div>

<!-- 

If you've messed around with the view blueprint, 
you've seen this in the index.html.

Let's simplify a littele further though.

[click] We don't need to import from config/environment,
as we only care about booting the app, not configuring it 
right now.

[click] so here we remove the config. but now this file is too small. let's inline the
application. 

[click]  This is the minimal way to boot an app -- it's still pretty small.

[click] And coming soon, you'll be able to specify services in here

# Booting an application

prior to ember-source 6.8.0-alpha.7

<div class="large-code">

```js
new Application({
	element: someElement,
})
```

</div>

<!--
So prior to ember 6 8 alpha 7, this is the only public API option for booting applications -- even
if all you have a single component.
-->

---

# Booting an "application" 

the easy way, after ember-source 6.8.0-alpha.7

<div class="large-code">

```js
renderComponent(component, {
	into: someElement,
})
```

</div>

<!--

After and including ember 6 8 alpha 7, we have this new api: renderComponent.

it is much simpler than the technique of making a whole application.

# ✨ Booting ✨ 

<!-- 

We'll come back to patching momentarily, but first we'll need to talk about 

the booting process, how an app starts up, blah blah blah.

# How to boot an application

<div class="large-code">

```js
import Application from './app/app';
import environment from './app/config/environment';

Application.create(environment.APP);
```

</div>

<!-- 

If you've messed around with the view blueprint, 
you've seen this in the index.html.

Let's simplify a littele further though.

# How to boot an application

<div class="large-code">

```js
import Application from './app/app';

Application.create({});
```

</div>

<!-- 

We don't need to import from config/environment,
as we only care about booting the app, not configuring it 
right now.


Let's simplify a little further.

<div class="large-code">

```js
import Application from '@ember/application';

class App extends Application {}

App.create({});
```

</div>

<!-- 
	This is how we boot an app.

# Booting an application

prior to ember-source 6.8.0-alpha.7

- `new Application()`

<!--
We don't always need new apis
-->

---

# Booting an application 

the easy way, after ember-source 6.8.0-alpha.7

- `renderComponent()`

<!--

This is a new API, and is much simpler than the technique of making a whole application

-->

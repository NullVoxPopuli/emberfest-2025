# ✨ Patching ✨

<!-- 

Ok, so now that everyone here is experts at debugging, let's say you discover something you want to
change. Something you want to test out in your project.

We can patch it locally before we commit to a PR.

<div class="centered">

<h1 style="font-size: 5rem"> ⚠️ PATCHING ⚠️ </h1>

</div>

<!-- 

Big disclaimer here though, patching is something you have to maintain.
I consider patches in big applications as tech debt.

If you instead submit a pull request, you won't have to maintain that code -- this is the ideal.

If you keep a patch around forever, you've decided it's more worth it to maintain your change
forever, rather than trick a maintainer to do it for you via pull request.

# Patching Ember

<div class="medium-code">

```bash
❯ pnpm patch ember-source
✔ Choose which version to patch · 6.8.0-alpha.7
✔ Apply this patch to all versions? (y/N) · false
Patch: You can now edit the package at:

  <.pnpm>_patches/ember-source@6.8.0-alpha.7

To commit your changes, run:

  pnpm patch-commit '<.pnpm>_patches/ember-source@6.8.0-alpha.7'

```

</div>

<!-- 

If you use pnpm, patching is super easy.

It's just two commands.

Now, you may thinking? Ember's perfect, it has no flaws? what could I possibly want to patch?!

Don't you worry, we'll get there shortly.

First, we need to get a sense of what's in ember.

These are all the packages.

There are quite a few.
